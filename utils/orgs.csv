Stuyvesant Cartoons Club,StuyCartoonsClub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/StuyCartoonsClub/846da031,Stuy’s cartoons club is a community of people interested in cartoons whether it is to watch or make them!,"The Cartoon Club is a community based club where we can connect with one another through cartoons. Whether it’s because of people’s nostalgia, educational interest, or other, the Cartoons Club offers a safe place to discuss each other’s favorites and potentially meet others with similar tastes as well. And no! Cartoons are not just for kids! Cartoons are meant to be enjoyed by everybody and we will provide a time and place for people to relax and catch up on the newest shows they may miss otherwise. Members are encouraged, but not required, to show up on time in order to not miss any part of the show we’d be watching. By the end of an episode, we can discuss our overall reactions, thoughts, and anything we’d like to share with one another. After every meeting, a google form will be sent out asking questions about the show and recommendations for new ones. Anyone may attend these sessions as a way to unwind from the stressful environment of Stuyvesant and sometimes during meetings we will learn about the intense procedure it takes to make a cartoon or show.","This activity will benefit Stuyvesant by providing a way for people to come together and express their artistic talents and opinions. Since Stuyvesant is generally a STEM-focused school, there aren’t many chances to explore different departments in the animation industry. Cartoons club is a place for students to relax after facing Stuyvesant's stressful and competitive atmosphere. It also allows members to connect back to their roots and become more knowledgeable about how cartoons they enjoyed, during childhood or any period during their life, came to fruition. Because of the club’s laid-back attitude and appreciation of all interests, the non-toxic environment will help members get through the hardships of Stuy's life. Students will form bonds and meet new people discussing the wondrous world of cartoons! We encourage members to recognize the community as one they can become social in, as Stuyvesant’s Cartoons Club is a non-judgmental space that allows students to express themselves, without outside pressure. The Cartoons club also wants to introduce the unique, artistic aspects and work process of people already in the industry to Stuyvesant High School in ways that have never been explored before. Members are encouraged to attend all provided meetings to not miss out on what we’ll be watching/exploring. ",Discord: https://discord.gg/kCwsUKVy9V Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stuycartoonsclub/ Facebook Group: https://tinyurl.com/2nsdh5xj,"The appointment of leaders for the Cartoons Club will take place at the end of every year through a google form once the current leaders are about to graduate or resign. Members will be given leadership positions on the basis of organizational skill, time management, and their enthusiasm for the club. The number of leaders will be based on the number of members in the club. The current leaders will conduct interviews with the potential candidates to make sure that the cartoon clubs will continue to last even after their departure from Stuy. If someone is not completing their responsibilities as a leader, then they will be removed from their position by the other leaders through a majority ruling. However, extensive warnings will be given beforehand. If a replacement leader is needed then the remaining leaders will decide for themselves how to find a better-suited candidate. Possiblies include a google form, interviews, enthusiastic friends, etc. Those holding leadership positions are expected to show up to at least one meeting a month and be responsive and communicative with other members and leaders.","The Stuyvesant Cartoons Club provides a safe place to unwind and discuss the beauty and significance of cartoons in everyday life. While there are other artistic clubs in Stuy, none compares to the love of cartoons this club has. Passionate creators all over the world pour their being into creating beautifully crafted cartoons and it is outrageous to have them go unappreciated. The Stuyvesant Cartoons Club provides a time out of Stuyvesant students' busy week to unwind and enjoy a good cartoon. It can clear their mind as well as open a new perspective on how to tackle different components of their life. ","We vary throughout the year, but we will usually try to have one meeting a week whether it’s virtual or in person.","['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday']",low,"['art', 'animation', 'film']",,"Andy Huang - Creator

Stuy Korea,stuykorea,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuykorea/1b5b968d,Our club aims to unfold the various aspects of Korean culture and language and provide a friendly environment for those who wish to learn.,"During meetings, Stuy Korea will alternate between teaching members the Korean language, fun Korean games, and about Korean culture. It will serve to help connect members interested in learning more about the language and culture to broaden their knowledge in a friendly environment. Other than just learning, members will do their own research to present on topics like Korean food, traditions, media, etc. There will also be movie nights through Zoom or in-person where members enjoy and analyze Korean media together, with subtitles of course. There may also be occasional meetings in or out of school to create a stronger sense of community within the club over regular meetings. There will also be events for Korean students that may not feel as connected to their culture to embrace their cultural identity. Members will be able to gain what they give to the club, and if they are genuinely interested in learning basic conversational and oral skills and attending the meetings on a regular basis, they will be rewarded with a valuable experience.","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community because, for one, it will allow Korean students to embrace their background and share their own insight on the language and culture. Moreover, students of other ethnicities will be given the opportunity to dive into the language and spend time studying the culture. This will, overall, break cultural barriers and allow students from all cultural backgrounds to come and work together towards a common interest. Especially with the recent rising interest in South Korean pop culture, knowledgeable leaders can inspire members to dive deeper into Korean media and set out goals for themselves to achieve and learn more about Korean, not only what lies on the outside. With the amount of diversity present within the Stuyvesant community, the Korean body may be slightly underrepresented, so this club will be a chance for students to be immersed in the Korean culture and be proud of themselves to feel comfortable opening up and expressing themselves for who they are as individuals. Additionally, there will be fun activities, other than just learning, during meetings that will allow bonding and the chance for students to share their love for Korean culture. Said activities include analyzing Korean shows/movies, keeping up with Korean pop news, and playing Korean games. ",,"The founders of the club will be appointed co-presidents (depending on each leadership cycle, there may be one president or two co-presidents), and other leadership positions, although not named yet, will be decided on based on prior experience in the language. This is because the leaders will be the ones teaching and guiding the members, so it is vital that they own a strong foundation on the actual language and culture. There will be one or two student teachers who will teach lessons on the Korean language and culture/history. There will be one social media manager who will manage the club’s Instagram and Facebook pages by giving regular updates and making announcements regarding the club’s schedule and agenda. The vice president will be responsible for handling club logistics and affairs. Lastly, the co-presidents will oversee, direct, and contribute to the smooth workings of all the executive positions. All roles will be chosen based on yearly applications and interviews. Proficiency in the Korean language and/or culture will be taken into consideration when choosing leaders with the social media manager as an exception. However, as the school year progresses, more leadership positions may be available and active members of the club will have the chance to apply and the best candidates will be granted the opportunity to lead based on their dedication to the club and display of passion towards the language. Selected individuals will work together with the board members to enhance the club and add any suggestions. At any point throughout the school year, if any individual in a leadership position fails to fulfill their responsibilities and/or displays inappropriate behavior within the club, they will be removed from their position based on the popular vote of the executive board or if both co-presidents (if applicable) agree.","Stuy Korea is unique because it will allow students who are interested in the Korean language, culture, and tradition to be exposed to a community full of fellow individuals who are fluent in the language or have also lived in the country for a fraction of their lives. We will be personally teaching the language based on what we believe is necessary to a solid foundation on the language and we will also take suggestions on popular topics. Students will be able to gain a deeper understanding of concepts they are already familiar with and also be given various opportunities to explore new terrains. Anyone who has watched a k-drama and fell in love, or wants to sing along to the Korean lyrics of a Korean song (and not just the occasional English parts), or just sparked an interest in the language is free to join and indulge in the meetings.","Our meeting schedule will vary throughout the year, but we will meet at least twice a month based on the members’ availabilities.

Stuy Tennis Club,stuytennisclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuytennisclub/40fe4548,The Stuy Tennis Club is designed to connect tennis players at this school with the aim to aid in the development of our games and the sport in general,"The Stuy Tennis Club will have several purposes in its association, mainly, simply giving students with similar interests in tennis a place to play and interact with each other. Our establishment will serve as a beacon to anyone implicated and gifted in the sport, as well as keen to prepare for their personal upcoming tournaments and joining the Stuyvesant Tennis Team. To be clear, due to restrictions on physical activities in clubs, this club will mainly be focused on meeting with people off the court at our meetings. Through that personal interaction with people of similar skill/levels at meetings, an environment which fosters the development and progression of the tennis-playing abilities of the group members. Basically, the club is designed to bring like-minded people together, in terms of tennis, and have them meet/interact with each other in order to ""lift"" each other up, in terms of their tennis playing skills. This is not to say that perhaps at certain times we would be open to officially going out and actually playing tennis, with our faculty supervisor, at designated tennis courts.","The key concept of how this activity will truly benefit the Stuyvesant community is by providing an opportunity for students to improve their game, and perhaps to play amongst others from the school and in other formal settings. Tennis has been proven to increase aerobic capacities, as well as bone density and reaction times. Tennis has shown to improve metabolic function and muscle tone, as well as lower resting heart rate, blood pressure and body fat. Tennis is also a non-contact sport, meaning that there will be little concern for body damage from parents and education staff, and it is a great stress-reliever, which is something that the average stuyvesant student can use. Tennis has also been renowned for the creation of healthy relationships; tennis allows players to have fun together, build skills, and develop into strong and able athletes. Moreover, tennis improves communication and teamwork skills. Therefore, our club isn't just about the sport, it's also about camaraderie, companionship, and creating a place for students to interact with each other and build positive connections founded on similar interests, making you a better person for the real world in and ahead of school. Overall, tennis is great for asserting health, physical capabilities, strength and agility, as well as increasing social ingenuity and mental health.",,"The way that the leadership position at this club will be rotated is that once the acting leader graduates, or for any extenuating circumstances is forced to give up their position, the leader will choose the longest-serving member since becoming leader, or the member which displays the greatest amount of dedication and commitment to the club (which may or may not also be the longest-serving member). Members are expected to have good attendance to our meetings, expected to act with respect and dignity, and display a degree of dedication to the club and their clubmates. A member can be kicked out of the club if they fail to attend multiple meetings in a row without providing an adequate excuse and/or act with disregard for the respect of people at Stuy, and in our club. A leader can be impeached if a majority of the members in the club (a leader cannot be included in this vote) decide that the leader is acting in a fashion which communicates a lack of commitment and desire to the club. A vote is necessary to impeach the leader, and a leader cannot be included in the vote. If a majority of members vote to impeach the leader, the leader will be impeached, and can be kicked out of the club. Then, a vote will be held to appoint a new leader from the remaining members in the club.","What makes our club unique is primarily the fact that the school lacks a Tennis Club in the first place, which means that our club will provide the sole rendezvous, if you will, for those truly interested in playing and learning about tennis with other players in their age group and skill levels. While our club is open to accepting players of all skill levels.
(though we prefer more dominant players and will make our membership decisions based on that preference), the authenticity of our affiliation is that the meetings and practices
are purely optional and are flexible for those in our group.","Although scheduling may differ, we plan to meet once a month or more and thrice in the Spring as required.",['wednesday'],low,"['tennis', 'sports', 'athletics']",,"Alexander Genkin - Creator

Stuyvesant RTS Games Club,RTS,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/RTS/1d03fb8a,"The RTS Games Club gathers players of all RTS games in a community where they can share their progress and further their love of these games.
","This club focuses on real-time strategy games, a genre mainly focused on slower games where you build up towards a strategy in real time. Examples of RTS games include titles such as Cities: Skylines, Total War, Europa Universalis IV, Civilization VI(kinda), Company of Heroes II, though it is not limited to those games and this is just a short list! Whether you play ten RTS games or only one, this is the club for you to find advice, multiplayer buddies, or generally just have a good old time. Another one of our goals is to find opportunities to bring the joy of RTS games to everyone; often, RTS games and their associated DLCs can be very expensive, and we want to work towards making the RTS experience more accessible. This would include announcing when certain games come out/go on sale, but beyond that, our first major project as a club(learning/playing Crusader Kings II) is our first step towards this goal. By playing a free RTS game as a club, we believe that we can accomplish both of the goals that we’ve outlined here. 
","In general, RTS games involve multiple players cooperating towards a certain result with each player having a specific role to play, sort of like teamwork! As such, this club will create a unified spot for players to meet and play with, therefore creating friendships with the foundation of group work. RTS games additionally require skills regarding thinking ahead, multitasking, and explaining to other members in both leading and explanatory ways. These are skills that can be learned, and have applications beyond the game into Stuyvesant life. Furthermore, we want to provide a different sort of benefit than you see with other clubs. RTS games can often be uniquely relaxing as they often involve a slow buildup towards a larger goal, meaning that they can often be a way to de-stress after the otherwise busy lives that we live as Stuyvesant students. This club would provide an outlet for this effect to happen. Finally, the games themselves can also explore subjects with real-world applications. With many RTS games focusing on historical events, playing the RTS games may increase interest to learn about those historical events. Furthermore, other RTS games(ex: Cities: Skylines) focus on concepts such as city planning. Overall, while these benefits might not be much, they still exist.
",https://discord.gg/7sqMst98UY,"The Club is run by a council of 4-6 students at any given time, as well as any given number of “game commissars” who are in charge of hosting and running games. Game Commissars can be added and removed by the council with a majority. The Council is composed of a mandatory 2 Seniors and 2 Juniors, and sometimes 2 Sophomores. All positions are elected by approval voting, and anyone in the club can run for their appropriate year-level position. The Council is in charge of matters relating to organizing meetings, maintaining the club discord server, rechartering the club, and other logistical needs. The Council is also in charge of amending the Club Charter as needed, with all amendments requiring a majority. Ordinary members of the club can also propose amendments and changes to the charter, approved by a majority of the club. Members of the council can be removed if a majority of the council and the club approve.","RTS games can often be less popular than their other counterparts due to its comparatively slow pacing, but we at the RTS Games Club want to make a club where RTS games can shine too! The RTS Games Club is based on creating an environment specifically around playing RTS Games. RTS games are also generally more fun with more people playing them, so the RTS Games Club wants to build an environment where people can play these games cooperatively to improve everyone’s gaming experience.
","Our meetings will generally be on weekends, but depending on when everyone’s free, games can take place outside of meeting times. All of our meetings will take place on our Discord server.

Craft for a Cure,craftForACure,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/craftForACure/2b53412f,"Through creative arts and crafts, Craft For a Cure aims to raise money for cancer research.","Through enjoyable arts and crafts, Craft For a Cure aims to raise money for cancer research at the American Cancer Society. During club meetings, members will work to create handmade items that will be sold during fundraisers and possibly online. Craft For a Cure seeks members with varying skills. Whether they're interested in crocheting, graphic design, jewelry making, or any other type of crafting, this club is perfect for them. By doing what they enjoy, they will be doing it for a good cause. Items that will be sold include stuffed animals, jewelry, uniquely designed apparel, phone cases, pin, keychains, mugs, etc. Craft For a Cure is also perfect for someone who isn't necessarily interested in arts and crafts. The club is looking for coordinators to spread the word, those interested in business to manage expenses, and even computer programmers to make and manage a simple online shop accessible by the Stuyvesant community. Each member is expected to contribute in some way whether it's creating the items that will be sold or managing operations. No matter what skills someone possesses, they will be a valuable part of Craft For a Cure.","Craft For a Cure is a safe space for people to flourish their talents and hang out with friends while also making a positive impact on the world. Every meeting is laid back as members get to participate in their favorite crafting activities. It doesn’t matter if someone likes crocheting while someone else strictly enjoys graphic design. Some people will be making small stuffed animals, some will design cool hoodies, and others will bead together cool pieces of jewelry. With a diverse array of hobbies, members will have the opportunity to teach each other new skills and explore new interests. Members can also take pride in their work, knowing that by simply doing what they love, they helping fund cancer research at the American Cancer Society. The profits made from the items created will be donated directly to the Society. Additionally, the items on sale will be directed toward the Stuyvesant community. Students, teachers, staff, and families can purchase the unique items that the members of Craft For a Cure create. Not only will they receive cool products, but they will also be supporting a good cause. Each of the items will be, in some way, related to the cause in order to spread awareness. For example, the designs on certain products will pertain to cancer research. Members of Craft For a Cure will also have many opportunities to share their ideas on how to improve the club and what new products to create.",https://www.instagram.com/stuy.crafts4cure/,"There will be several different branches within Craft For a Cure. Each member can take part in whichever department they wish without any restrictions. There will be a creative section, a business section, and an outreach department. Each of these subsets will have one or two people managing it. For example, the manager(s) in the creative section will oversee everyone's work and make sure that all crafts are reasonable for the purpose of the club. That manager will, however, also be expected to produce items just like the others in the creative section. The business section will require two managers. They will be in charge of managing finances and making sure that the money earned for charity is a decent amount. They will also be responsible for overseeing that the money is properly and fully donated to the American Cancer Society. Finally, there will be leaders in the outreach department who will be in charge of getting the word around about the club. They will manage social media accounts, create posters, and organize the means of selling products. All of these leadership roles will be appointed based on applications at the beginning of a semester. Leaders will be chosen for their dedication, accomplishments, and skills specific to that section. The club as a whole will be overseen by two co-presidents who will also be chosen through applications. If a member cannot attend a meeting, they must contact the club's co-presidents with their reasoning. If a member misses more than two meetings without contacting the co-presidents, they will be automatically removed from the club. If a member is deemed unsuitable for the club by any other member, that member can inform the leaders. Then, the co-presidents and leaders of all sections will take a vote on whether to remove that member or not. A simple majority would win. Valid reasons for voting to remove a member include rowdiness, disrespect towards other members, and unproductivity (not participating in the activities). None of the leaders may vote to remove a member for personal reasons.","Instead of holding typical fundraisers, members of the Craft For a Cure get to creatively express themselves while also funding cancer research. Members don't even have to consider themselves creative to join. The club consists of members with a wide variety of skills, ranging from crafting talents to business skills. Everyone gets a chance to utilize their specific talents for a good cause. 1 in 3 people is diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. So far, the American Cancer Society has invested $5 billion in cancer research.

Stuy Linux,stuylinux,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuylinux/af5c1cc3,Stuy Linux is a beginner-friendly club that lets members explore Free/Libre Open Source Software (FOSS) that respects the user and their rights.,"Stuy Linux aims to be an educational community for those interested in software freedom, security, and privacy.

Members will be encouraged to join a a casual chat community on a freedom and privacy respecting platform (to be determined) where its members can congregate, discuss new developments, and aid each other with technical endeavors or issues. The core focus of the club will be on this asynchronous chatroom (similar to the Stuy Transit and Urbanization Association), hence its low-commitment status.

In addition to this space, presentation-based meetings will be held in-school to introduce Linux and associated programs to the club's member base. Experienced members will be encouraged to contribute and/or teach lessons, allowing for members to learn from the talents and know-how of the best in the community. The club will also organize discussions on F(L)OSS-adjacent topics, such as software releases, vulnerability/hack incidents, and licensing ethics. The lessons will try to be as accessible as possible, with topics being taught from the ground up, and members being guided through the processes every step along the way.","F(L)OSS applications are commonly used by significant technology firms, like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (colloquially known as FAANG), Microsoft, IBM, and even the school's gradebook, Talos. By introducing members to these software suites now, members can develop familiarity and expertise with software they will encounter in Computer Science job fields, if not in college. The use and development of these programs encourages the use of critical thinking skills for problem solving, providing a practical and fun activity for members to partake in. Further, by playing an active role in the F(L)OSS community, members are able to develop their programming experience by contributing their services to the community, while also meeting professionals working on critical projects.

Our internet-connected society provides a plethora of opportunities for abuse, such as via mass surveillance (spyware/telemetry), mass advertising (monetization of personal data), and other destructive malwares (wipers, ransomwares, etc.), which can severely affect a society (such as the 2021 JBS meat-packing cyberattack) and disrupt the free expression and discourse within it. Proprietary software sequesters these capabilities and more thanks to their concealed nature, but people can counteract or avoid such evils with F(L)OSS alternatives that act more efficiently and transparently, granting them the ability to build a better and more free future for all.

F(L)OSS applications are also more accessible, for they generally do not impose any monetary costs to obtain them. This allows for most people with a personal computer to try out Linux and related F(L)OSS technologies on their own, for free.",https://stuylinux.org,"The founders will take the first leadership roles within the club, working to administer, organize, and develop the lessons for club activities. Throughout the school year, as new positions are deemed necessary, those who volunteer and possess the necessary skills can sign up for them. Those who have performed in an unsatisfactory manner will be replaced, or have their positions supplemented by another member. This includes club leadership, as if a club administrator is not performing in a satisfactory manner (not active and/or contactable for at least 1 month, repeated cases (3+ warnings from others) of being off topic, or in other ways problematic (3+ complaints from fellow members)), they may be demoted and their power will be given to another newly elected leader and the other leader. Active members who contribute to the club may be selected by the co-presidents to succeed them. If a co-president is unable to decide one individual to succeed them, they may nominate their recommended members for election, to be conducted via a poll ran on the club's primary communication platform. At the end of the school year, the leaders of the club will post feedback forms for the club members to convey their thoughts on the year's proceedings.

Stuy BotC - DO NOT USE THIS,botc-old,False,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/botc/3b9407ed,This club allows people in Stuyvesant to make friends with similar interests while also practicing their deduction skills and having a fun time.,"In this club, we play Blood on the Clocktower, a social deduction game similar to Among Us and Town of Salem, in that there is a minority of people who know who each other are going against a majority who votes on who they think is part of the opposing team, except that it is more complex, as there is a person who runs the game, known as the Storyteller, who gives people their roles and processes people's abilities and votes, while also themselves playing a part in who wins the game. Additionally, when you get killed by the minority team, you are still a player in that you can still talk and even vote once in the game. Additionally, it is played in real life, in a real Stuyvesant classroom. It is expected that by attending a meeting, you try your best to win the game without cheating in order to make sure that everyone has fun playing this game.","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community by helping them make friends with similar interests. This is important because finding friends in this time of one’s life can lead to lasting and lifelong friendships. This activity will also benefit the Stuyvesant community by improving people's social deduction skills, and by generally improving people’s ability to talk with others. Building up social confidence is very important to one’s later life, depending on what career they may pursue. It will also give Stuyvesant students a way to have fun, which is something they need to have motivation for certain stressful assignments. It also allows people with interests in this type of activity, social deduction games, to have a way to do it, as groups whom actively play this game in particular are hard to find, leading to a unique experience. Additionally, as Blood on the Clocktower is a game of thinking, it allows students to use the intelligence that they clearly have based on their ability to get into Stuyvesant through Specialized High School Admissions Test to a purpose that they find enjoyable. In conclusion, the Stuy BotC club is beneficial to the Stuyvesant community because it will assist students in making friends, improving people’s ability to communicate with others, allows students with interest to pursue it, and allows students to put their intelligence to a purpose that they find enjoyable.",https://discord.gg/BNpJ4Rk4tC,"The organization of the meetings and the managing of the Discord server is currently to exclusively be done by people who currently have those roles. We do not see the need to have more, but if neither of the leaders are available during a week, we may appoint an active community member to handle a meeting. If the club gets big enough that there is a necessity for multiple games per week (20 people can fit per game), then more leaders may be added in order to maintain club meetings multiple times a week. They will be chosen based on how active they are and their skill at storytelling. Storytelling at first will be done exclusively by the club leaders, but as we see skilled players, we will develop a turn-based system where every week a different person that is interested will be the Storyteller. Once the current leaders graduate, the new leaders will be selected based on how active they are in the club, their skill at Storytelling, and their interest in a leadership position. If, for some reason, the leadership team or the community as a whole views a leader as unfit for the club, then we will let said leader know what they were doing wrong and if problems persist, we will remove them from leadership.","This organization is unique because there aren’t very many groups that regularly play Blood on the Clocktower. This group is the only social deduction club in Stuyvesant, so students that are interested in this type of activity do not have many choices. Many people haven’t played games similar to Blood on the Clocktower, so joining this club will lead to students having a unique experience.

StuyPy,stuypy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuypy/e441e24e,StuyPy is a beginner-friendly club for learning how to solve problems and innovate using Python.,"StuyPy will unite Stuyvesant students in learning how to program using Python, to problem-solve, and build projects. StuyPy aims to introduce members to Python and provide them with a strong foundation in the field of computer science from the ground up. StuyPy is an extremely welcoming and inclusive club, where everyone can join, regardless of experience level. Members are not required to attend meetings, but frequent attendance, participation, and effort are recommended. StuyPy will introduce members to fundamental computer science principles, which will transition into the Python programming language. The club will employ a blend of presentation and lecture-based learning, and interactive hands-on project-based learning, catering to different learning styles. After everyone understands the fundamentals, there will be themes to introduce members to various fields of practical applications of Python. Through themes, members can discover their interests and understand the inner workings of a particular application. Regarding outreach and events, StuyPy will reach out and work with other clubs and organizations to provide members with more ways to further explore their interests. StuyPy will also plan a few events throughout the year, such as an end-of-the-year hackathon, where participants can demonstrate their newly acquired skills from the club. Overall, StuyPy is a no-cut club that provides a casual environment for members to learn more about Python, create fun projects, and meet new people.
","Through the StuyPy club, members will learn, bond, and have fun. A lot of people are interested in learning how to code but are unsure how to start or find coding daunting. At StuyPy, they will learn from the ground up. People who had never looked at code before in their lives can become experienced programmers in no time. Projects that we will be learning how to create include creating bots, graph data, creating functional applications, scraping data off the internet, and more. StuyPy members will also learn how to innovate, solving problems that are important to them with the power of coding. By learning how to code, they also learn essential problem-solving and communication skills, as well as creativity and persistence. Since Stuyvesant is a specialized high school with a heavy emphasis placed on STEM, many people know how to code in this school, and by learning how to code, StuyPy members will be able to meet new friends, bond, and have fun. In addition, members that are interested in coding beyond StuyPy can join other related clubs and classes. In essence, StuyPy will provide an opportunity for Stuyvesant Students to learn, bond, and have fun. They will be able to problem-solve, innovate, and communicate.",https://www.instagram.com/stuypy/,"There will be 2-3 (co)presidents, who lead the club, oversee club operations, maintain contact with the school administration and the rest of the council, and create and teach lessons. One of the presidents will charter the club via StuyActivities, but all presidents will receive administrative privileges in StuyActivities, the Discord, and the club in general. The presidents hold leadership applications in the summer before the fall semester. The presidents are responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of the club, as well as communicate with our external organizations. The Teacher-Assistant department is responsible for assisting with the creation of lessons as well as helping members who are confused or stuck while the presidents are teaching the main lesson. The PR department is responsible for graphic design as well as managing our social media platforms. The outreach department is responsible for reaching out to many potential sponsors for prizes and partnerships when we inevitably hold our hackathon event in April. This ""cabinet"" can do the following if the supermajority of the cabinet agrees: - Impeach presidents in question for valid reasons. Members are expected to obey the rules of the club and join at least one meeting a month. Everyone is expected to follow the rules of StuyActivities and the rules listed in our discord server

 ","StuyPy is dedicated to teaching programming on an extremely beginner-friendly and basic level. Members will learn by doing: using projects as a way to immerse themselves in various topics and to overall have a better understanding of the Python language. Furthermore, StuyPy has a drive to only teach Python, which focuses members’ attention on one specific language to minimize confusion and to learn the full extent of Python. Lastly, StuyPy will also host events to keep the club interesting and fun, such as an end-of-the-year hackathon or guest speakers.","If there are events that impede with many of our schedules, we may hold a remote meeting or cancel the meeting, but we will usually meet on Thursdays",['thursday'],medium,"['python', 'coding', 'computer']","To join the club, you must apply on StuyActivities first.

Also, students can obtain community service hours for college applications. Remote biweekly meetings Tuesdays from 5 to 6 (PM) on finding ways to make money without external knowledge. Students are often looked down upon due to their young age, but within this club, students will learn to accomplish personalized “hustles'' that target their specialties. Peers with similar interests will be able to get to know each other. With a program of such a wide range of skills and abilities, the possibilities for education are limitless. Students can teach each other a variety of skills including how to play instruments and how to cook (depending on their personal interests). Knowledge can and will be shared through the club while also making the community a better place. Seminars include lessons on Branding, Promoting, and Officiating. Occasionally, people who successfully took a mere hobby and made it a successful career field will join.","Students choose skills that they have proficiency in to promote and brand themselves to make money as a side job outside their school lives. This builds experience which will be necessary when looking for jobs in the real world. Students can receive hands-on practice with the world outside of a school setting while, again, gaining money and experience all at once. Many of the potential jobs allow students to gain community service since they will be bettering the community. Many students have yet to decide on a career path however, with the assistance of StuyHustles students receive the chance to experiment with a variety of career fields to test their options. Ultimately, students receive a far clearer idea of which area of interest they may want to pursue as a legitimate life career. StuyHustles saves students the time of searching for opportunities that match their fields of interest that would actually provide them with a monetary incentive. Students also learn to enhance their pre-existing skill sets to make themselves known to the public on a variety of platforms such as social media. Students will also be able to participate in a community of high-achievers who may possibly have similar interests as them. ",https://linktr.ee/stuyhustles,"StuyHustles features a multitude of leadership positions: Scribe, IT Manager, Chief of Outreach, Chair of Opportunities, Director of Organization, and Leader-in-Training. The role of the Scribe is to send out Feedback Forms//Meeting Agendas (Monthly), write up emails to send out to members for events/updates/etc, send out biweekly email reminders to members with the Zoom link, send out reminders 3 days before, 1 day before, and one 30 minutes before meetings, and send out biweekly emails to students with the link to the slides from the last meeting. Next, the role of the IT Manager is to take attendance, make sure Zoom meetings are going smoothly, help with Instagram (uploading posts and stories), create feedback forms (through Google Forms), and work with the Chief of Outreach to formulate emails/messages to reach out to people over technology (email, socials, etc). Furthermore, the role of the Chief of Outreach is to send out personal DMs to students making them aware of the club, generally promoting our club on the Stuyvesant Facebook Page, sending out emails to officials (like teachers and staff) asking them to let their students know about StuyHustles and to remind other leaders and members to advertise the club on their personal socials or let their other Stuyvesant friends know about this opportunity. Following, the role of the Chair of Opportunities is to help find Guest Speakers that best fit our wants, find ways for students to make money, contact people who have experience in this field that would make an excellent guest speaker, and help make slides. As for the role of the Director of Organization, they grammar check our slides before meetings, answer questions/comments in the Zoom chat, help us schedule out Guest Speakers, help create monthly schedule calendars and, choose posts to send to IT manager to post. Moving on the role of the Leader-in-Training is to oversee and make sure the rest of the leaders are on track. They are accountable for giving strikes, creating lesson plans, and experimenting on themselves (with different jobs, etc). As a reform to keep leaders accountable, leaders will be given a strike if they are not sufficiently meeting the needed requirements for the given position. After two strikes, the member will have to resign from their current role. In order to receive a leadership position, applicants must fill out Google Forms which ask questions that relate to the specific role.","In StuyHustles every individual receives the opportunity to display off their unique talents. There is no one particular targetted subject/study, rather tactics that can be applied to any interest. Students can promote themselves and their knowledge to the fullest. Their personal ""job"" can be anywhere from making children’s books and tutoring to helping people move. After going through lessons on how to promote ourselves self, we will test our skills by branching onto the real world. We will apply our skills to make money while branding ourselves which is the ultimate goal.","Meetings after school, twice a month, Wednesdays, 3:40 to 4:30 PM.

Stuy Tetris has in-person meetings structured with a 10-20 minute Google Slides lesson followed by playing together in groups using the website https://jstris.jezevec10.com/ . Lessons will talk about controls, rules of the game, the Tetris effect, combo strategies, T-spins, tips and tricks, and more. Jstris offers the option to create private rooms for members to play in, which is a function Stuy Tetris will utilize. Meetings are optional for members (though it is highly encouraged to join so members can practice with each other), and the Google Slides lessons will be available for everyone after the meeting. Every Stuy student is welcome, no matter how much experience a member has with the game.","Tetris is a game that helps improve spatial awareness and visualization because of the frequent need to manipulate tetrominoes into a specific shape or space; members may find it easier to manipulate, rotate, and rearrange real-life objects in their heads. Tetris also requires thinking ahead to account for pieces that players would have to move around later on in the game. The Stuyvesant community can utilize this club as a space to relax in, since the point of the club is to learn something new while having fun. Plus, having a Stuy Tetris meeting every two or three weeks can help members unwind after a tiring week of school. Playing on the Jstris site and using a keyboard can help release excess energy in a player's hands and fingers, especially if they have been feeling antsy. There has also not been a club that plays Tetris or arcade games, so this would be a great way to group together people who enjoy Tetris. Tetris is also a game that many people think is old-timey, so playing a modern, more flexible multiplayer version can introduce more people to a different mindset about Tetris so they can see that old games are still relevant.",https://linktr.ee/stuytetris https://discord.gg/acWUBvfgx8,"Leadership positions include the President and the Vice President(s). The President will lead the meetings while the Vice President helps out with what the President needs assistance with (such as sending out emails, creating lessons, helping teach lessons if they know the material, etc). The President must be knowledgeable in Tetris basics and strategies in order to teach the members in the club. When leadership positions are being transferred, the remaining club leader will choose the best person to promote based on how they have been behaving in the club (ideally they are knowledgeable, are cooperative, and have good chemistry with the club). If they are applying to be the President, they should be tested for decent knowledge of the material being taught. If the President is not doing their job or if there are any issues with the club, members should tell the President or bring it up in the feedback form (linked in the Linktree). A fourth of the club (not counting the President) has to agree that the President should step down in order to let the Vice President take over (or if the Vice doesn't want to, the Vice will appoint a new leader they see as fit for the job). If the Vice President is not doing their job, the President can open up the Vice President position to other members. If members are not cooperating (trolling in Zoom, not responding to important messages, etc), they can be kicked out of the club.","There aren't any other Stuy clubs that are about Tetris or arcade games, so Stuy Tetris would cater to the students who like Tetris already and to the students who want to learn more about it. Stuy Tetris also teaches a multitude of strategies that can come in handy when playing Tetris.

It aims to educate, equip, and inspire girls, as well as guys, with the computing and technical skills they’ll need to pursue computer science as a passion or career. It hosts after-school workshops to teach girls about computer science topics and skills beyond the classroom, such as competitive computing or data analytics, organizes field trips to large tech companies like Google or Buzzfeed, as well as provides a supportive environment to encourage girls to continue pursuing STEM fields. Successful women in the tech industry are frequently invited as guest speakers in meetings. Girls Who Code meetings aim to give girls the confidence they need to succeed in a traditionally male-dominated industry. Meetings are not required, and members can come at their own leisure to learn a variety of topics in computer science.","Girls Who Code @ Stuy creates a supportive environment for females in computer science. Although the statistics at Stuy are slightly better than nationwide, there is still a huge drop in the retention rate for females progressing from Intro CS classes to AP Computer Science. Research has shown that effective mentorship early on for aspiring female computer scientists can significantly increase their desire and confidence in staying in this typically male-dominated field. The main goal of the club is to provide that mentorship for many females pursuing computer science for the first time. The club hosts workshops, Q and A sessions, and field trips to expose girls to computer science beyond the classroom and hopefully inspire them to consider computer science as a career. In addition, Girls Who Code is a great way for girls to network with each other and with other successful computer scientists to establish some ground in the industry early on. The club also hopes that having upperclassmen student mentors, many who have succeeded in the Stuyvesant computer science courses, guiding them through the process will encourage them to keep taking computer science courses throughout their Stuy careers. In short, the purpose of Girls Who Code is to benefit the minority of females in computer science and close the gender gap in STEM fields overall.",https://linktr.ee/gwcstuy,"The club board is split into four positions: presidents, directors, student mentors, and secretaries. Presidents oversee all aspects of the club, which include scheduling meetings, developing lessons and teaching during meetings. Directors manage the board and help bring the presidents' vision to life. Student mentors create lesson plans about CS topics, present lessons to members, help the members as needed with projects/exercises and provide mentorship in small groups and one-on-one. Secretaries handle some of the logistics of the club by taking attendance, writing minutes, organizing event opportunities and completing permissions for the club's guests. Directors, student mentors, and secretaries are appointed before each school year begins through a written application and an interview with the club presidents, and they do not need to have experience in the club. Club presidents for the following year are appointed during the Spring semester through a more rigorous written application and interview with the current presidents, and they must be dedicated board members. Board members are expected to complete all tasks in a timely manner, maintain a good academic standing (85+ average) and be present at all club meetings (with the exception of excused absences). If a board member fails to complete their tasks and/or is excessively absent at meetings, they will be given a warning. If their actions continue to be unsatisfactory, they will meet with the club presidents and club faculty advisor to discuss the situation and may be impeached.","Girls Who Code is unique because it is one of few clubs that uses learning and academics to address social injustice. The biggest problem for women in STEM is the inability to fit in with other programmers, and the club believes that education early on is key for their retention in this field. Although there are quite a lot of computer science clubs, Girls Who Code is one of few that uses its responsibilities as a school club to address larger social issues.","Meetings typically occur every Friday.

StuyAnatomy,StuyAnatomy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/StuyAnatomy/7111b786,StuyAnatomy aims to provide students instruction and opportunities in exploring the anatomy of living beings,"The purpose of StuyAnatomy is to create a community of students who are similarly interested in the Anatomy and Physiology aspect of biology through lectures, discussions and ultimately competitions. Lectures will mostly be broken up by body systems, where the president or vice president will create lectures and related activities to instruct other members about the subject. However, members are always welcome to research whichever system interests them the most. Lectures will not be the main part of the club, as discussions and diagram drawing using the school’s blackboards will also be instructional. Ultimately, the goal is to prepare for anatomy competitions around the USA, so there is also going to be practice time where we look at past tests and also compete amongst ourselves using a points or buzzer system. Since this is also a community who is possibly interested in majoring in biology or going into pre-med in college, this will also be a space for such related discussions. Ultimately, this is a community that’s supposed to make learning human anatomy and how we are able to function as an organism both fun and informational. 
","The activity offers students in the Stuyvesant community the unique opportunity to learn about anatomy which is a subject that is not taught in the school’s courses and is traditionally known for its rigor and complexity. The club provides comprehensive weekly lessons and resources which allow students to delve into its various topics while providing an advanced level of comprehension with hands-on experiences through the use of models and dissections. Students will gain understanding in identifying various structures throughout the human body as well as other organisms at varying levels of organization while learning about their function and interactivity which allow for life to persist. Involvement in the club’s activities not only benefits members’ knowledge within anatomy but also helps students which are interested in further studying related subjects in the future within the biology and pre med fields. Furthermore the club will provide resources and preparation to students who have a particular engrossment in anatomy to participate in potential tournaments and competitions. As a result of the nature of the subject, the club naturally creates a strong community that aims to expand their knowledge through camaraderie. Overall, Stuy Anatomy provides an environment for students to not only develop their passion and love for anatomy but also allows them to form strong connections with people that share the same interests. 
",@stuy_anatomy,"The president(s) and vice-president(s) of the club are chosen by the club’s previous president(s) just before leaving the club. Previous presidents will enact sound judgment and ground their decisions based on a participant’s dedication and commitment to the club. These two aspects will be considered using attendance logs as well as engaged participation in weekly club meetings held in-person at Stuyvesant or virtually. Considered alongside dedication is passion and knowledge in the subject. The leader must either be already knowledgeable enough in the subject, or be willing to put in hours and study the subject. This is to ensure that he/she/they is able to teach other members of the club, including any new members or old members who might already know some rudimentary knowledge. In order to run for president or vice-president, the member must also have been a part of the club for at least a full school year. Finally, if a significant majority of the club decides that any of the students in a leadership position are unfit for their designated positions, after approval from the faculty advisor, new elections will be held for the position in question.
","StuyAnatomy is unique since it is one of the only clubs with the sole focus of studying human anatomy and its various systems. This allows club members to not only gain a general understanding and appreciation for our body’s day to day functions, but also provide the opportunity for people to dive deeper into whichever facet of the human body they want to understand. Additionally, the team based format of the Anatomy competitions also demands for the use of teamwork, communication and collaboration skills.

As such, they may feel that they don’t have an opportunity to share their perspectives on any topics, from very casual and relatable to personal and deep, with anyone really. Considering the situation of the past two years, it’s been hard for many of us to open up, due to our lack of social development. This club believes that it’s important to open up and share different perspectives with one another, as it improves individuals socially, emotionally, mentally, and academically. As such, this club provides an open, judge-free, and friendly environment for students to do just that. If students feel comfortable, they can discuss any and every topic, such as interviews, podcasts, and trivias, they’d like. StuyInterviews plans to gather a wide range of student volunteers to discuss the topic of the month. StuyInterviews intends to record these podcasts, interviews, and trivia and edit them to make them both informative and interesting once shared with the entire Stuuyvesant community at the end of the month.","As students in Stuyvesant, exploring different people’s perspectives on all sorts of topics, ranging from authors to scientists is incredibly thrilling. As such, students take courses in European Literature, World History, Physics, and more. All these courses are designed by individuals from two or more generations ago. So, students aren’t able to gain true insight into the current generation. Also, students don’t gain insight into their very own peers' perspectives, as these courses are aligned to a specific disciplinary study. They don’t allow for the discussion of mental, social, and physical development, which students definitely need due to the unforeseen circumstances of the past two years. However, this club would do just that and much more. This club would not only allow students to gain insight from their very own peers undergoing the same situations as them but also allow them to build lasting friendships. Volunteers can choose to discuss any topic, ranging from casual to personal, that they feel comfortable with, and many of the volunteers are bound to share similar perspectives with one another. As the volunteers begin to recognize this, they may form strong, lasting friendships with one another, which would be another outlet for them to share their unique personalities and perspectives with one another.",https://linktr.ee/stuyinterviews,"There are five available leadership roles, with a maximum of two people per role: Manager/Interviewer, Outreach Director, Content Creator, Filmer/Editor, and Web/Graphic-Designer. The Manager/Interviewer ensures that other leaders are on track and interviews all volunteers. The Outreach Director contacts potential volunteers through Instagram and Email. The Filmer/Editor records all interviews and edits them to be published as a post, intended to be shared with all members of the club. The Content Creator generates event ideas (such as “Why Stuy?”) and formulates documents to help ideas come to life. The Web/Graphic-Designer is responsible for creating a website where all publications will be updated and creates posters for all upcoming events. Potential applicants can apply for a role(s) via a google form that will be sent out through Instagram & StuyActivities as a post. Afterward, applicants can expect an interview (rough 10 minutes) to brainstorm ideas for upcoming events, and to test their creativity of the applicants.

StuyTFT,stuytft,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuytft/ecd71a75,"The Stuyvesant TFT club gathers individuals who enjoy and love the strategy game TeamFight Tactics into a fun community.
","The Stuyvesant TFT club is a group of players and fans of the video game Teamfight Tactics published by Riot Games. This club seeks for TFT players to come together and interact with each other within a welcoming environment. Anyone is free to join this club and participate in its club activities, no matter their skill level. There will be many activities that allow club members to socialize with each other, such as coaching sessions and hosted tournaments. The coaching sessions will include individual 1 on 1 sessions with a high elo coach or group lectures, where games played by the best players in the world will be analyzed, and discussions will be held about the mechanics and strategies of the game. The club will also have a year-long in-person tournament that ends with a playoff. Participants will be expected to play weekly games to qualify and get seeded for the playoffs at the end of the season. The tournament is completely free for all members and there will be a monetary prize given to the winners. Any donations to the prize pool are greatly appreciated. The tournament will be a valuable way for members to learn more about the game and improve their skills while interacting with other club members playing in the tournament. Any discussion in the club will be welcomed, whether it be a simple question or a rant about anything that frustrates you about the game to get off your chest.","The TFT club will benefit Stuyvesant by introducing students to the game and teaching them how to play, as well as connecting existing players with each other to form lasting friendships. It will serve as a welcoming and relaxing environment for all members, even if they are just getting into the game, and it will facilitate lasting social connections between members involved in the club. Coaching sessions and tournaments are some of the many ways that this club will bring like-minded TFT players together whether it’d be players playing against each other in a tournament or a coach helping a student to become better at the game, fostering a sense of connection. As TFT is not a widely recognized game in the gaming community, we wish to bring the scattered player base of TFT in Stuyvesant together so they can interact with each other and have a good time. TFT is a free autochess strategy game that allows players to develop portable skills like problem-solving and fast reaction times. It is also a simple and relaxing game that is good for increasing players’ self-confidence when they win and allowing them to take responsibility for their decisions when they lose. TFT as a game inspires players to become more persistent in achieving their goals, whether it be a rank-up or a win in a tournament. In a school that has many stressed students every day, we wish to bring TFT to the Stuyvesant community within the form of a club, create a haven for overwhelmed students or TFT enthusiasts to come to, and most importantly, build a fun club for all.
",https://discord.gg/EywP8faUGq,"We will have two co-presidents, a treasurer, a head coach, and social media manager. Some protocols that members are expected to follow include understanding the purpose of the club and maintaining its positive and relaxed atmosphere. Members with leadership positions are expected to be present in most meetings unless there are more urgent commitments such as schoolwork or family. Our leadership positions will be determined through a vote by the club's passionate members. If a leader fails to meet the standard of the members, then a vote can be held to impeach the leader with a 65% majority needed. We will offer training positions where newer members can learn about the different roles and see if they are fit for the job. The trial period will last for 2 months and at the end of the school year, a new council of leaders is elected to replace graduating members :) .","The Stuyvesant TFT club is unique in that it is the only club in Stuy that deals with the auto chess genre, not restricted to TFT. The Stuyvesant TFT community is prevalent yet scattered, and this club is a good opportunity to unite the community and allow people to form lasting friendships. TFT is a game in which you can have fun by yourself but most of the fun in TFT is in playing with other people, which we hope to build an environment for. Lastly and most importantly, the Stuyvesant TFT club is open to all. There’s no rank requirement or any prerequisite to join the club or to participate in any of our activities. Even if you’re a new player, our club is excited to have you and we hope that you will have a good time with us.","Our meeting will depend on the availability of the players, but we hope to meet on Tuesdays and every week of the month, with breaks when there is a new set.

Stuyvesant Music Outreach League,SMOL,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/SMOL/50a9ccae,"To use our musical abilities and talents to bring joy to those around us.
","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have all felt a sense of isolation from the world and from those around us. However, music can serve as a method to help connect people. Whether it is through Zoom or in person, music can provide companionship to those who are isolated or feeling lonely. In addition, music also has a variety of benefits on a human being whether it is psychological or medical. For instance, Alzheimer's, which is an extremely prevalent disease among the elderly, can be relieved through music. We hope to use Stuyvesant’s wide range of talents and passions for music to bring smiles and comfort to the elderly and those in need. With our club, we would arrange concerts at nursing homes and senior centers with the different pieces of music the members of our club have been working on. We also aim to form duets, trios, quartets, and more to prepare music solely dedicated to the season and time of the recitals (i.e. Halloween, Winter Holidays, Summer, etc.). Through having these performances, members will receive volunteer/service hours. ","SMOL will facilitate an environment where students who share a common interest in music may gather for the benefit of the less privileged. Members will work together and learn from each other and their experiences. As it is commonly known, the students of Stuyvesant are extremely talented. However, many of them are not given the opportunities to present and share these talents with others or are too nervous to. Our club would provide such students and any with the interest of performing the opportunity to perform and bring joy to those around them. We would also help those who struggle to put themselves out there, get used to and learn how to deal with nerves and worries. Simultaneously, this will bring together students with similar interests but different musical skills to learn to work and perform together (duets, trios, quartets, and more), exposing them to different areas of music. While expanding students’ experiences and skills, we would also provide an environment where fellow musicians can receive feedback and practice performing. With these performances, students will also receive service hours for doing something that they enjoy. Ultimately, SMOL will provide an environment of positive feedback, inquiry, and community for those who wish to expand and share their talents and use them for others’ benefits.",,"Leaders will be chosen based on their demonstrated commitment to the club--meeting attendance, individual musical growth, and how often they contribute to and participate in outreach events. Throughout the years, those interested in leadership positions will be given applications to complete, and the information on the applications will be anonymously given out to the members of the club. Then, members of the club will vote upon who they believe is best fit to become the next co-president of the club. Regarding members, it is not super crucial that members attend every meeting, but if one signs up to perform at a given event, then they must show up to rehearsals and meetings prior to the performance. Though members certainly do not have to sign up for every performance, it is important to take advantage of as many performance opportunities as one can—especially as past attendance is also a factor in establishing leadership positions. However, if one is met with an unexpected responsibility, then an excuse form may be filled out, and the member may instead provide proof of preparedness for the performance. There is a limit of three excuses per year. 

If leaders are found to be breaking the charter or taking advantage of their position, then the members of the club can bring it to the attention of the club, and the members can vote on the continuation of this leader’s position in the club. Votes must be in favor of the majority. ","Stuyvesant students will be given the opportunity to organize and perform in outreach concerts, benefitting not only Stuyvesant but the communities that surround it. Participation in the club allows students to further their own musical skills through collaboration and performance, at the same time actively aiding the elderly and others in need. Talent and passion for music that often goes unheard throughout the school day can be shared and appreciated among like-minded colleagues--this is vital to personal and musical fulfillment within individuals, and can also be put to good use and have benefits beyond students and groups within Stuyvesant.
","Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we plan to meet a few times a month to check up on each other, and as we get closer to a performance, we would meet more often in order to review and run through what we have planned. We have stated that our meetings will be held on Thursdays, but this can be adjusted to meet the needs and preferences of the members.

Supercell games are incredibly popular within Stuyvesant, and we aim to both welcome existing players and attract new ones. The club's Discord—which boasts over 100 members—serves as a great opportunity to meet and engage with new people through a shared interest in mobile gaming. While our focus may be on Supercell games, the community is particularly casual and outside discussions are encouraged as well. The server also offers members a chance to improve at gaming whether this is through receiving advice or finding teammates to play with. The club also hosts an online (optional) game night every Friday, allowing members to unwind after a long week of school. In all, the club's main priority is to create a low-commitment environment in which Stuy students can enjoy their favorite Supercell games. ","Within such a high-pressure environment as Stuyvesant, having a more enjoyable activity to look forward to at the end of the week can serve as a source of motivation to carry students through their schoolwork. Stuy students often have to remind themselves that it is okay to indulge in free time and less productive hobbies. As it can be difficult to truly enjoy oneself while under heavy stress, the club offers an opportunity to have genuine fun with others who are ultimately in the same boat. Furthermore, the club's Discord server fosters social interaction among students looking for a welcoming community to be a part of. As such, those struggling to find friends at Stuy—especially new students—may find solace in meeting new people amid the club's casual atmosphere. Alternatively, members who are simply searching for a way to pass the time can do so within the server. Regardless of what one's circumstances are, playing some of the top games out there with fellow students can be a great pastime to have, whether this be Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, or even Hay Day; when the only goal is to have fun, there is nothing to lose in trying. ‎ ",https://discord.gg/yBuWEZQSDs,"As Stuy Supercell has been ongoing for two years now, a multitude of leaders has already been appointed throughout the years. However, members who have demonstrated a clear commitment to the club are still able to apply. The club's leadership positions—which are granted through both StuyActivities and Discord roles---are as follows:
Stuyy Park Gold - Responsible for the below as well as hosting game nights.
Stuyy Park Grey - Responsible for the below as well as keeping members in check.
Stuyy Park Green - Responsible for maintaining the organization of the server.
To apply for a leadership position, members may message a staff member and a vote will be taken among them. Members are not expected to follow any particular protocols other than being respectful to one another. Leadership has yet to be transferred between school years, but when this does occur, it will likely be through a voting system. Impeachment may occur when a staff member’s faulty behavior is reported by either a member or another moderator. If this occurs, the moderators will look into the issue and decide whether a warning or a stripping of permissions is sufficient.","Stuy Supercell is unique in the sense that it covers mobile games, and a multitude of them at that. Moreover, nearly all of the club's activities are held online, entailing that participation in them is a stress-free commitment that can be enjoyed from the comfort of one's home.

Stuy Walks,stuywalks,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuywalks/edf00d1c,Want a way to get low intensity exercise and socialize at the same time? Stuy Walks goes on weekly walks together.,"This club might help get Stuy students up and moving in a way they wouldn't otherwise. It also lets students meet new friends in a less awkward setting. Members in the club will participate in weekly (or more, depending on demand) walks either around Stuy, or if permitting, up the Hudson river or around Battery Park City. Members will be able to choose to go as many times as they want a month, and it will be okay for people to pop in a few times. Members can find a community of people who want to get exercise but either aren't able to run or don't like to run. Members can choose to either walk alone or with a partner, and they will be able to swap partners during the walk if they want. The club will be open to anyone who would like to walk so long as they are respectful of the environment around them and make space when others want to walk by (aka no one will be taking up the whole sidewalk). There will also be opportunites to have themed walking days, where there is a particular talking point or theme that people will walk with.","Power walking, and walking in general, are two great ways to get low-intensity exercise. People who may not be able to run or who just don't like to run might be able to find a better or more acessable way for them to move their body in walking or power walking. According to Harvard Health, walking reduces the risk of developing breast cancer, boosts immune systems, and eases joint pain by strengthening the muscles around your joints. Power walking specifically helps people reap the most benefits of walking, and guides people to a proper stance to reap these benefits. According to the Mayo Clinic, walking can improve cardiovascular fitness, increase energy levels, improve your balance and coordination, and even reduce stress and tension, which many Stuy students have in abundance. A good walk can leave you feeling tired but also energized. This club will also provide members a way to meet new people who also have a passion for walking or a desire to do low-intensity exercise, and help people make new friends. Walking and talking to someone can be very motivating, so this will help get Stuy students to exercise more. The club also hopes to foster friendships where people can go out and go on walks together outside of the school setting, therefore helping reduce stress even more.",,"Leadership positions include co-presidents who will usually be two seniors, a vice president, and an events manager, in the case that the club ever organizes something like a walk-a-thon. Co-presidents will be responsible for scheduling meetings, arranging walking paths, and coming up with topics to talk about to your walking partner. The vice president will be responsible for sorting out who wants a walking partner and arranging people's preferences - such as if someone wants a partner in the same grade, or one who is the same gender, etc. In the event there is a bigger event, the events manager will plan and organize it. The vice president will automatically become a co-president, and will be initially appointed by one of the co-presidents. The other co-president will be nominated and elected by the club's members. The vice president should be either a sophomore or a junior. The co-presidents should be either juniors or seniors, but preferrably seniors. The events manager will volunteer if an event is ever propositioned. If there are multiple volunteers, they should all be involved in planning the event. In the event that any leader is found to be neglecting their duties or to have broken the SU club rules, members may impeach that leader by holding a vote. Then the members may nominate someone else for the position and hold a vote to make them the new leader. ","While the cross country team sort of fills the hole of being a both solo and group sport that is lower intensity and outside, running isn't for anyone. Since there currently is no walking or power walking club in Stuy, this one will let students be able to come together to enjoy the (relative) outdoors while not being in too much nature and having too much hassle (unlike hiking). This will be a low-commitment and low-sweat way to move your body and relieve stress after a long day of school, as well as meet new people if you want.","Depending on what the club's advisor and the administration allows, this club will go outside, weather permitting, once a week on Fridays, but possibly other days if there is interest.",['friday'],low,"['walking', 'social', 'exercise']",,"Cassandra Fenwick - Co-President

","Vocalasia is a vocal cover group club specializing in singing Chinese, Korean, and Japanese music. The club will aim to cover one song per language every month (so at least 3 songs), either through Youtube or singing live at a venue/school event. Most of the singing will be done in groups, but there will also be solos, duos, and trios if anyone desires. Anyone can join regardless of skill/experience, and no audition is required. Leaders will teach members everything they need to improve. This club is medium-high commitment because members are expected to learn the lyrics to the song beforehand through easy lyric youtube videos. Songs will be chosen based on a majority poll/vote, and there will be a theme each week (such as back to school, summer, girl crush, boy group, etc). If anyone prefers to sing a different song than the song voted for, they will be able to do so in a smaller group or individually. ","Vocalasia will push members out of their comfort zone through the live performances and recordings. Members will be able to learn more about East Asian cultures through other members and share this knowledge with non members. Every voice will be showcased regardless of skill and experience. If anyone feels uncomfortable singing live, even if they have a passion for singing, they can record for the youtube videos until they are satisfied. The club aims to work with other clubs and organizations at school such as the orchestra, who can provide the live instrumental component of the song, dance groups who can dance to our recorded vocals, or open mic. If possible, and depending on how many members would want to do so, there can also be a volunteering component of the club such as singing at nursing homes or singing for charity. Stuy students will be able to destress and have fun singing with others who share the same passion through performances, karaoke, and watch parties.There is also a non-singing aspect of the club that Stuy students can experience. Those who enjoy editing videos, photography, and videography, are welcome as well. The goal of this club is to be inclusive of all Stuy students who come from all walks of life and have diverse interests. ",https://linktr.ee/stuyvocalasia,"The current Presidents and Vice President were already chosen for this term due to their capability to successfully manage a team. Once the President graduates, the vice-presidents will become Co-Presidents or President and Vice President. General leaders were also chosen based on a google form application and dedication to East Asian music. However, members who show clear commitment and passion and willingness to learn and lead may be selected by the leaders and a majority vote by club members to be on the leadership board. Despite this, every member has the chance to be a leader through each song as they can sign up to help teach a specific song (as long as they let it run by one of the board members first). If for any reason, any leader misses too many meetings, greatly offends someone, produces hate speech, or anything of that matter, they will be impeached through a discussion with the leadership board and a majority vote within the club.
","This club is the only East Asian vocal cover group at Stuy. While there are Kpop and Cpop clubs, those focus on dancing. There are also acapella clubs, but those do not include instrumental and require auditions. Anyone is welcome in this club, as long as they have a passion for singing and a willingness to learn and work as a team. Members can also perform live at school events and venues as well as record covers for youtube. The club also covers one song per week, allowing members to try many types of songs in Chinese, Korean, or Japanese lyrics. Members may also gain experience singing solos, duos, trios, and in a team.
","Meetings will typically be once a week, but there may be additional meetings if the club is performing at a venue or school event. A poll will be sent to the club facebook group to determine member availability per week. This club also performs at the annual SOS showcase at the end of the year—typically performing one song of each language. During the preparation stage for the show, the members will split into three groups (one for each language) and may have different practice days.",['monday'],medium,"['singing', 'kpop', 'cpop']","Many prospective members may have concerns of learning the lyrics to a foreign song.

","The Stuy Foreign Affairs Association (SFAA) brings students together with a genuine interest in charting our country's future and playing a role in international affairs. The club connects members with experts in the field, such as guest speakers, primarily experts in international diplomacy. Guest speakers provide first-hand accounts of challenges in their fields, such as global strife, climate change, and humanitarian crises. Students will learn ways the past has shaped the present as they inform themselves about current events and make themselves more conscious members of society. The club exposes students to ideas and thoughts on pressing questions in foreign policy, enabling them to understand and interpret international relations. Students can supplement their passions with a club that explores how diplomacy and related skills are applied in the real world without the pressure of competition. This club is the perfect starting point for students envisioning a future career in these fields.","While learning solely from an academic standpoint might prepare students for the world after high school, students might not always have the opportunity to apply their knowledge in a vast field of careers. At SFAA, we foster a space for students to engage in topics that aren't readily available in humanities courses, especially for freshmen and sophomores. Authored by the most qualified and experienced leaders of foreign policy decision-making, the Foreign Service Journal provides a valuable perspective on foreign policy of the past, present, and future. Additionally, we aim to provide valuable information from world-class, experienced leaders and much needed organized and effective practice while covering a topic that interests participants, motivating students to strive for excellence and even to decide on a career path. Gaining knowledge and skills in diplomacy will help students prepare for careers in policy-making, legal work, and the business world. Finally, our club members will emerge with improved public speaking, communication, negotiation, and marketing abilities. Members will become more proactive in discussion-based classes and more confident expressing their opinions. Students with an awareness of their society feel more inclined to develop universal traits for success and, more importantly, support and shape their community and the world.",@stuyfaa,"A month before they graduate, the Presidents will vote for two additional students they feel have contributed and demonstrated dedication to the club, who will become the subsequent presidents if elected and approved by the existing leaders.

The Vice President of Internal Events is responsible for planning meetings, creating presentations and lessons, and occasionally giving speeches. The Vice President of Communications manages the social media platforms, emails, and connecting with the SU/other clubs/rest of the school. The Vice President of Public Outreach facilitates reaching out to other charters and potential guest speakers while advertising to future student body members and occasionally giving speeches. If executives violate the rules, they would be subject to impeachment, requiring a petition from members, and removal, requiring a two-thirds majority.","The club provides opportunities for students who may be experiencing challenges in humanities by regularly assembling interactive lessons and inviting experts in the field as guest speakers.

Additionally, when you get killed by the minority team, you are still a player in that you can still talk and even vote once in the game. Additionally, it is played in real life, in a real Stuyvesant classroom. It is expected that by attending a meeting, you try your best to win the game without cheating in order to make sure that everyone has fun playing this game.","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community by helping them make friends with similar interests. This is important because finding friends in this time of one’s life can lead to lasting and lifelong friendships. This activity will also benefit the Stuyvesant community by improving people's social deduction skills, and by generally improving people’s ability to talk with others. Building up social confidence is very important to one’s later life, depending on what career they may pursue. It will also give Stuyvesant students a way to have fun, which is something they need to have motivation for certain stressful assignments. It also allows people with interests in this type of activity, social deduction games, to have a way to do it, as groups whom actively play this game in particular are hard to find, leading to a unique experience.

They will be chosen based on how active they are and their skill at storytelling. Storytelling at first will be done exclusively by the club leaders, but as we see skilled players, we will develop a turn-based system where every week a different person that is interested will be the Storyteller.

So come at any time to enjoy our fun activities and revel in everything Harry Potter!","When asked how the Harry Potter Fan Club will benefit the Stuyvesant community, the answer is simple - Harry Potter has brought people together for years and we believe it will continue to do so in Stuy. The Potter community is the most close-knit family of lively, welcoming people there is. People love to leave their own worlds to enter that of Harry Potter, and in the often stressful climate of school that has never been more important. Yet everything is more meaningful with friends, so why not journey to the Wizarding World together? We plan to create action-packed adventures and make the most wonderful memories with people who live the Potter world just as much as we do. And of course Stuyvesant is one of the most competitive schools there is, so we feel that it is important to create a healthy outlet for our competitiveness - through Harry Potter trivia! At last, we can gather outside of classes to bond over the books and movies we love. The 4,100 pages of Harry Potter we have been left with are all wonderful and packed with amazing ideas the fan club can discuss while we deepen our love for the incredible, extraordinary Wizarding World.",,"Samantha Ruinsky and Alexandra/Sasha Ruinsky are co-presidents.

stuyChemEng,stuychemicalengineering,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuychemicalengineering/5feb4260,stuyChemEng spreads the fundamentals of chemical engineering and its real-world applications through presentations and fun activities.,"According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in chemical engineering is said to significantly increase by nine percent in the next decade, like any other career paths. As supposed, chemical engineering is a demandable application in the real world, and stuyChemEng hopes to alleviate any stress that comes from that through simple teachings. stuyChemEng wants students to explore the many fields of work under chemical engineering that are both common and uncommon that will help expand their knowledge on this field. SCE hopes to foster a community and unify those who seek a passion in STEM through heavy discussions about the benefits and obstacles of chemical engineering. This club also welcomes those who are not as knowledgeable as others in the field and would like to provide as much guidance as possible through useful and insightful meetings and activities to help build an interest in this particular field.","Although at first glance chemical engineering might seem to be a very specific field of engineering that primarily revolves around chemistry, it is much more than that. Chemical engineering requires the knowledge of all three mandatory science courses at Stuy (biology, chemistry, physics), problem solving skills, and mathematics. With this in mind SCE hopes to further anyone’s passion in these subjects so that they can pursue a future with it as chemical engineering can be applicable to many possible career paths (ex. Pharmacy, nanotechnology, etc). However, not everyone who joins has to know exactly what they want to do as we also want to nurture or even develop interests in the sciences. To do this SCE will have lessons and activities based on the applications of this field so members can see how it compares with other fields of engineering or the sciences. The lessons will additionally touch on topics that will be taught in classes so it can serve as a way to understand the material conceptually or its real-world applications. SCE might also go into subjects that are beyond the curriculum at Stuyvesant so that members broaden interests in a specific part of, for example, the chemistry curriculum that isn’t taught in-depth.",https://stuychemeng.carrd.co/,"This club consists of three main leadership roles: 1-2 Co-President(s), Manager of Internal Affairs, and Manager of External Affairs. The Co-President is in charge of leading the club through the development of lesson plans with presentations and hosting club activities. The Manager of Internal Affairs handles social media platforms, proofreads lesson plans and social media posts, and reaches out to club members via email and social media as a reminder for upcoming meetings. Manager of Internal Affairs is also required to take minutes and attendance for each meeting. Members are welcome to reach out to the Manager of Internal Affairs for any feedback and assistance they may need. The Manager of External Affairs reaches out to potential guest speakers that have a strong experience in the field and is required to consistently promote the club to students. They work closely with the Manager of Internal Affairs to write up meeting emails for students as well. Future leadership will be determined through Google Forms that will question applicants on their interest and ability to partake in leadership, which will later be checked over by the Co-President(s). No prior leadership experience is required, but is prioritized to those who have shown dedication and commitment to the club. All leaders must show their dedication and communicate efficiently with the rest of the board and members. If any leader fails to show their dedication to their role or is constantly absent during meetings, their leadership may be at risk of being revoked. In this case, all club members would vote on its removal. Club members must attend both monthly meetings, unless excused by a board member, where attendance is taken.","The field of engineering is difficult and overwhelming to navigate due to all the fields within it. However, stuyChemEng aims to focus on a specific field within engineering commonly known as chemical engineering. To achieve this, SCE will provide lessons and activities based on an application or aspect of chemical engineering. These lessons will incorporate what students have learned in their science classes. From these lessons and activities, SCE aims to develop a general understanding, or even passion, towards the subject that was focused on.","We plan to meet bimonthly, specifically every other Tuesday after school.",['tuesday'],low,"['stem', 'engineering', 'science']",,"Rabab Chowdhury - Co-President

Stuyvesant Weightlifting Club,stuywlc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuywlc/aeaec046,We seek to educate and inspire students to begin or improve their journeys in fitness and weightlifting.,"We will hold three weekly meetings for both discussions of core tenets of fitness, and for training and improvement in physique, bodily strength, and technique in weightlifting. Club members are expected to come to at least one meeting per month in order to absorb important aspects of core disciplines such as training, dieting, and maintaining a proper balance between fitness and career goals. Members will be routinely performing a variety of weightlifting exercises adjusted for their needs and goals, such as free weight, machine weight, bodyweight, and isometric. We will also discuss good practices in fitness, advising students on the safest and healthiest long-term decisions for how to get in better shape through topics such as calories, supplements, macronutrients, vitamins, cardio, and more. The leadership of the Stuyvesant Weightlifting Club is dedicated to providing students with important perspectives and advice that can improve their physical well-being in an increasingly sedentary academic environment.","As many at Stuy will know, the primary goal of almost every student is to achieve academic success, whether that be through a high GPA, 5s on all their APs, or a great volunteering and leadership record. Regardless of the avenue students choose to express their ambition, it overwhelmingly tends to the academic and educational setting. As members of New York’s best-rated high school, it’s sometimes easy to put aside other priorities in place of academic success, such as proper nutrition, healthy amounts of sleep, and our focus in this club, consistent and regular exercise. Despite this, routine exercise and proper nutrition serve as the bedrock for a healthy lifestyle, not just healthy study and work habits. Combining learning and exercising into a fun, educational, and personally rewarding experience is our goal for students at the Weightlifting Club. Research has shown that people who take at least half an hour a day for moderate to high-intensity exercise are much more likely to be happy, have a more positive attitude towards life, and pursue their goals with greater motivation. Students who gain the personal discipline achieved through steady, but rigorous and consistent weight training can apply it to almost every aspect of their lives outside of the gym, from school, to other extracurricular activities, to their professional careers far into the future. Additionally, weight training is likely to greatly improve students’ physical fitness, self-confidence, and body image.",https://stuywlc.com/,"President - Schedules meetings, leads physical training activities (with the help of an advisor), leads lecture meets, provides personal assistance to students

Upperclassmen (Junior/Senior) presidents are recommended to have a younger student as a candidate for their replacement upon graduation. Existing leaders that are not due for graduation may continue their leadership role between school years, provided they do not resign or get removed. 

Students, both members, and leadership are expected to create and foster an open, free environment where everybody feels comfortable participating in any activities taking place and feels welcomed as a member of the club. Any students or leaders who violate this rule will be removed, as hate and ridicule are not welcome.","Very few other clubs in this school are focused on introducing students to physical fitness and exercise, let alone a highly focused discipline such as weightlifting. We hope that students will feel as though they are provided with a new way to express themselves, both with a new hobby to partake in, as well as a new avenue to pursue their personal fulfillment. Our club will also be run by individuals with high weight training experience, as both the President and Vice President have over a year of history with gym-going and weight training exercise.

Fiscus,fiscus,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/fiscus/2d3d539c,Our mission is education-equality by giving back to underserved students and educating students (in and out of Stuy) about finance in a unique way.,"Fiscus at Stuy is the Stuy school chapter of Fiscus. We have a one-of-a-kind layout where we engage in a multitude of projects to provide educational opportunities to the less fortunate. The purpose of Fiscus is for Stuy students interested in education-equality to engage in projects with that mission in mind. We hope to launch projects such as teaching children (young or old!) about finance to help them grow as young adults and offer more learning opportunities for all ages. We are in the process of developing interactive lessons to host on our website in regards to finance as well as figuring out how to hold a year-round virtual stock market competition for students from anywhere to join! We believe that learning and mastering the concept of finance is crucial to living successful lives, but is rarely touched upon in a formal class setting. We want to change that by giving students a comprehensive introduction into finance! In addition, the purpose of Fiscus is also to pay it forward! Members can join two main groups- finance or fundraising/donations- or even switch it up! Working in the finance department, you will be working to roll out the two projects that we are currently working on (interactive finance lessons and year-round stock challenge). If you decide to participate in our fundraising/donations team, you will be responsible for planning and operating as a team with other members to coordinate (like the name suggests) fundraisers and donations for the events that we are currently undertaking (our projects will range from donating books to schools in Africa to raising money for school supplies for a local shelter to doing clothing drives for children in Africa). Most members will likely settle in one of these two roles; both are equally important! Regardless of which one, all members are expected to be either tutoring or spending their time planning the process of fundraising for our cause.","Fiscus will allow Stuy students to share their passion for finance with younger children and do good by helping raise funds/educational supplies. Stuy students will also get the chance to learn more about managing their own finances as well as some tech related skills as well while developing the interactive online curriculum and/or developing the stock market challenge- all valuable life lessons to learn regardless of what you wish to do in the future. Not only will the Stuy community receive a unique chance to delve deeper into the world of managing their own personal finances, but they will also be able to contribute to our mission of giving more school-aged children opportunities to learn and succeed in the future. In terms of fundraising and donations, Stuy students will be contributing to a good cause by helping to raise money and educational resources for shelters, libraries, hospitals, schools, etc. Anybody can contribute to making a donation- even by spreading the word! We will be making posters and boards to show where anyone can donate. Anyone can become a member of our team and help us fundraise! We will be holding fundraisers around the school community and in parks/environments around the school. We will be donating everything we get to a cause that we -as a team- will decide upon together in order to support the underprivileged and those who need help!
",Instagram: @fiscus.us,"Leadership Positions that will serve on the Board of Directors are the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Finance Officer, Director of Recruitment, and Chief of Technology. For positions that have not yet been filled, they will be appointed based on commitment to the cause, an understanding of the job’s roles and tasks, time onboard Fiscus, and an application. Positions can be added or taken away if deemed necessary by the Board. The appointment of a member to a leadership position and the policy for the transfer of leadership are the same: members will fill out an application for the role that they desire via Google Forms and the current Board of Directors will collectively come to an agreeable decision and will let applicants know immediately once a verdict is reached. All executives are responsible for adhering to our 3 strike policy for accountability (linked here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1sHacFn6neUkpt0aPPc2iOE9g4zAJUyia6hCchzpwI/edit?usp=sharing) Members are expected to come to all scheduled meetings unless notice of an excused absence is given, to provide input on ideas/projects, and have/maintain a strong commitment to our mission, cause, and nonprofit. Members that do not give good reason for absences will incur strikes- after three strikes one's membership will be under review.","Even though there are numerous finance and nonprofit educational clubs at Stuy, we have yet to see one combine into a cohesive whole while pursuing projects such as ours. Here at Fiscus, we are giving future generations the education that they need to succeed and practical life skills of managing personal finances- two things that go hand in hand. Our goal centers around reaching out to students of all ages as we believe that the earlier you start on the path to financial wellness, the easier it will make your life down the road. The mission of Fiscus is not only to provide a comprehensive guide to money- management, but also to teach young adults to be financially savvy from starting a checking account to understanding interest. And not only are we educating young adults on finance, we are also gathering books, donating money, and more educational supplies to the less fortunate as aligned with our goal of providing as much help to school age students as possible because in the 21st century, education should be free.",Our meeting schedules are flexible and revolve around the best times for our members.

Stuyvesant Transit and Urbanism Association,stua,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stua/3d1f123b,"STUA aims to study, discuss, and educate others about public transit and urban planning","This club informs the school community about the safe and efficient use of public transit on many levels. We plan on developing and releasing services that communicate the status of transit around Stuyvesant and the transit routes that most Stuyvesant students utilize daily. This club will also engage in trips and excursions on or relating to transit in order to promote the appreciation and further understanding of transit. This club also serves to educate students on principles of urbanism and urban planning and apply them to solve problems that exist in reality. In addition, we aim to promote the use and expansion of public transit as well as the improvement of urban design to center around transit, walkability, equity, and health. 
This school year the STUA aims to have a more formal presence in the school community. Therefore we would like to move towards better organization, whether that may be by using the StuyActivities calendar more frequently, or reactivating the STUA Facebook Group for important announcements.
Members are expected to read our social media, such as, but not limited to the official club Facebook page, and Discord server, for announcements regarding club meetings, activities, and upcoming events. Participation in these activities are not strictly mandatory, but encouraged, and the level of commitment is dependent on each member’s own ability and desire. Our main form of inter-club communication will be through our Discord server, where members can interact with each other and propose new ideas and/or activities. Additionally, some club activities, such as our Guess the Station game, will be held online, so we encourage members to stay posted regularly.
","The STUA seeks to engage in projects to improve the school community, including but not limited to plans to introduce a bike rack at Stuy and using the second-floor TV to display transit information. Both projects will improve the transit experience at Stuyvesant, and hopefully encourage more students to not only optimize their commutes but choose more enjoyable forms of travel (biking, ferries), which in turn may improve their mental health as hinted in scientific studies linking mental health to exposure to the natural environment. 
The STUA additionally seeks to partner with similar clubs (such as Stuyvesant Environmental Club) to hold meetings on the environmental effectiveness of transit, how it can connect and influence different cultures, and how it can be safer to protect the Stuy community. 
This activity benefits both the general school community and students with specific interests in public transportation and urbanism. This activity benefits Stuyvesant because it is a place for students interested in urbanism in general, or transit specifically, to meet other students interested in the same topics. Additionally club trips and events outside the school such as would give students the opportunity to explore places they may have never visited before, and to explore transit infrastructure firsthand and in person. Oftentimes the exploration of a piece of infrastructure in person is more educational and instructive than simply discussing the place. It also helps the general Stuyvesant community by providing resources that increase safety awareness on transit, provides useful information about the system and how to navigate it, and general service status.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/965895540429484,"Members applying for leadership positions must submit a series of short responses to questions on an online questionnaire created by the current leadership of the club. The current leadership will then review the submitted responses and attempt to make a decision as to whether or not the applicant is fit to assume the position for which they are applying. The current presidents have full discretion over the designation of future leadership positions, one of which must be the president. It is possible for co-positions to exist at the current board’s discretion. 
If it is determined that additional members are required for the board to function efficiently during the next school year, the current board must present a Trial Leadership opportunity to the club. Trial Leader applicants must complete an application assessing their vision and ideas for the club’s future. The current board will use this information, along with the observed applicant’s interest in meetings and other club affairs to select an applicant for Trial Leadership. The number of trial leaders will be the number of positions the board requires for the next school year.
Trial leaders have the same responsibilities as the current board members in the department, and are expected to contribute to club operation as if they were a board member. If a trial leader is satisfactory, they will gain membership of their respective board department in the following school year. If this is not the case, the board reserves the ability to select another applicant for the board position in the following year. 
In general impeachment circumstances, when it is an appointed board member that is exhibiting unsatisfactory performance, all other members of the board, including the trial members, must hold a formal vote on the impeachment of this member. If all other Board members agree, the member in question will be removed from the board. If the board determines that there is a shortage of positions in the leadership following the removal of said member, the board can alternatively choose to elevate a trial leader to the vacated position in a following vote.
","This club is unique because it is the only club at Stuyvesant centered around public transportation and urbanism, and because it has many components that do not exist in any other club, including Guess the Station games (in which players have to guess which station a photo was taken at), transit excursions (in which club members get to experience new subway lines and transit systems), urbanism meetings (in which we discuss future plans for a variety of cities, including New York), and presentations on the history of public transportation.
STUA is interested in collaborating with other clubs within and outside Stuyvesant to promote equity. Additionally, we also plan on working with community leaders outside of Stuyvesant for input on urban planning proposals created within the club.","The club will function on a per-week basis in regards to meetings. Meeting dates will be posted to the club social media and to StuyActivities, along with other events (e.g. fundraisers, trips, etc.). Meeting dates will be determined in advance by the Co-Presidents when necessary, but meetings will generally take place from 3:45 - 5:00.
Meetings at the school, when they are held, will be geared towards urbanism, and students will get the opportunity to discuss the future of cities with other students passionate about the subject. Meetings as a whole will be geared towards transit. 
We wish to use club feedback to improve meeting attendance, by reworking meeting dates and adding urbanism-based concepts as meeting topics. We will submit an idea for a club meeting on the club's media platforms and poll members on their availability. When this is assessed, the meeting will be scheduled on the said day.

","Our club provides many benefits for the school. One major benefit this club provides is a friendly environment where club activity doesn't have to only be a thing done for colleges but also something students can have fun in. Not only this but this club will also serve to develop and nurture student's interest and fascination in the STEM fields, especially chemistry. If some members are struggling with Chemistry, we can also do some tutoring lessons from upperclassmen who have already taken the class. Also, this club will expose students to research and intern opportunities hosted by the American Chemical Society by inviting professors with an ACS membership and past ACS interns to be guest speakers at meetings. We also plan to do some college planning and lectures hosted by some current college students to help juniors and seniors navigate the college journey and have a better picture of what college life is. These college help will also serve to decrease some stress in the student body, especially when college is basically a new home for the students. Also, with Stuyvesant being such a competitive school we hope to create an environment where people can relieve stress and not worry about competing against each other. Aside from academic benefits, we just want the members to meet new people and make new friends. ",https://discord.gg/up2KBQj5cS,"All positions in our club are given to new people each year through a strict appointment procedure. The next three co-presidents are chosen by the current presidents with consideration of their interaction with fellow club members and their engagement in the club throughout the year. After the co-presidents are appointed, they will be responsible for appointing the position of vice president(s). The vice president(s) is appointed after answering questionnaires that assess their interest and abilities and undergoing an interview. The presidents are responsible for running the club, setting plans for future events, reaching out to possible candidates that want to speak in the webinar, and overseeing the order of the club. The vice-president’s job is to assist the president in running the club and setting up webinars and events. In addition, all members with leader positions are expected to fulfill all their duties in the club, do their best to help the other members, and try their best to make it to each club meeting. As for impeachment of either the presidents or vice presidents, that will be brought into consideration if they show consistent lack of dedication to the club without proper reason. All the members will vote towards a final decision.","Our club will be supported and recognized by an established science publishing organization (ACS or American Chemical Society). Another unique quality of our club is that we will be inviting professors from various universities with ACS membership to be guest speakers at our club. These guest speakers will introduce to us the research projects they have done and some details on the nature of their work. We also plan to invite past ACS interns as guests to share their experiences working in a laboratory setting with a mentor and provide examples of other opportunities that current students of Stuyvesant can take advantage of.

Be A Leader Association (BALA),bealeaderassociation,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/bealeaderassociation/41c388b3,"This club aims to help students become more confident, develop traits that are attributed to leadership, and explore leadership opportunities.
","In a school this populated and competitive, it can be difficult for students, especially incoming freshmen, to come out of their shells and confidently explore the hundreds of opportunities that this school offers. As such, the Be A Leader Association’s goal is to assist students in the process of blossoming and leaving their comfort zones. Leadership qualities are crucial to develop in high school, are often looked for by colleges, and can be attributed to success in life. Our meetings, guest speakers, and miscellaneous methods of student support exacerbate the developing of confidence, communication, and management skills. BALA also gives students the opportunity to get support with adjusting to Stuyvesant and to get advice from other students who have been through similar experiences. Members gain assistance in discovering their true potential as students and leaders of the Stuyvesant community, subsequently encouraging them to take advantage of leadership opportunities. It is a service that would be much appreciated to students who need help gaining confidence and learning to thrive in a competitive environment.","It is easy to be intimidated and wary of pushing your personal boundaries in the new environment of a specialized high school. This club helps students overcome their fear of jumping into new experiences and making mistakes in the process. At the moment, students (especially freshmen) are likely aware of the vast array of opportunities that Stuyvesant offers, but still may not explore them due to the concern that they will “end up messing up” or that “everyone else is already better at it.” BALA is committed to creating a space that encourages students to gather up the courage to pursue their interests, both by meeting others who feel the same way and by learning and engaging in group discussions on the topic, backed up by articles and occasional guest speakers. More underclassmen would be encouraged to run for leadership positions within Stuyvesant and outside of it, not only benefitting the students themselves but allowing for younger representation in said positions. Reiterating the point of having guest speakers and outside resources, upperclassmen can also benefit from club meetings even if they aren’t new to the school. Essentially, BALA allows all of its members to grow and learn to be more confident and assertive together, helping everyone get closer to reaching their full potential as productive members of the Stuy community - not to mention make friends with similar goals.

This can be based on any justifiable reason, including club involvement, leadership skills, trust that they can carry on activities, or other examples of the successor being fit to administer and lead. If members have issues with the leadership, they can reach out and attempt to resolve the conflict (by any means, including electronically or going through the other leader). If these attempts fail or don't help the situation, members can reach out to the other leader to call for impeachment. To do this, they must have the support of 50% or more of the club's member list (this can be displayed via petition signatures), in which case the other leader must take action and impeach the unfit one. If they are both unfit to lead, club members can take a vote or use some other fair measure to decide on new leaders as a group.

There are no prerequisites to join, as all necessary material will be covered during meetings. Members are encouraged to come to as many meetings as possible. There are three sections: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. In the beginner section, we will teach beginners a language before exploring introductory topics in algorithms. The intermediate section is for students comfortable with coding who will learn data structures and algorithms from solving contest problems. In the advanced section, we teach advanced algorithms in preparation for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO). Additionally, members in each section have the freedom to present CS topics they are interested in. A few times a year, we organize trips to invitational CS competitions, such as the PClassic at the University of Pennsylvania and the Cornell University High School Programming Contest. 
","Stuyvesant is a school famous for its STEM based curriculum and activities. We have a wide variety of clubs in every subject area imaginable that are geared towards competition. We have a Speech and Debate Team, a Quizbowl club, a Robotics Team. In the field of Computer Science, we have many advanced classes such as Software Development, Systems Level Programming, Computer Graphics, and Cybersecurity that you would be hard-pressed to find at any other high school. 
However, we do not have a club that is aimed towards coding competitions. StuyCCC aims to fill this gap. We foster a community of passionate programmers and help them excel in the most prestigious CS competitions. We take enthusiastic students who are already interested in programming and expand their knowledge. We expose them to programming competitions and give them the skills (in the form of CS concepts, data structures, and algorithms) and opportunities (referring them to different online competitions) they need to succeed in them. It’s a club that devotes itself to the theories of CS and explores said ideas through coding. In addition, we create a space for students interested in programming to come together and explore new concepts together. Our Discord community has over 300 members and continues to grow, attracting students from Stuyvesant and other schools in New York. 
",https://discord.gg/Wd2FxeE,"The appointment protocols for leadership positions are as follows. People will be asked towards the middle of the school year if they would like to be considered for leadership positions. Based on their knowledge base of the content as well as their level of activity in the club, the current leaders will decide on the people being chosen for the leadership positions.
The impeachment protocols for leadership positions are that anyone that is inactive in the club for a certain period of time or has not been contributing to the club in any way without a good reason will be impeached by vote by the other leaders in the club. In short, it will be a democratic process.
Members are expected to:
Be respectful towards everyone
Try and learn the topics that are being taught and to ask questions if they are stuck at any point
Join in discussion of different topics when they are being talked about or to at least to go over the recordings of content on their own time
","No other clubs at Stuyvesant focus on competitive programming. We provide students with a solid foundation in theoretical computer science that will help them excel in coding competitions. Students will also carry that knowledge into their APCS classes, CS electives, college classes, and even coding interviews. Most importantly, StuyCCC develops problem solving skills that are easily transferable into other subjects. 
StuyCCC’s focus on short problems instead of longer projects makes programming a lot less intimidating for beginners. Students who participate in other STEM competitions, such as those from Math Team, will be also familiar with the format and approach to problem solving. 
StuyCCC’s Discord community is a place for people to talk about coding in general, not just limited to competitive programming. We have dedicated channels for general CS topics and also an anime fanbase, so anime enjoyers are also welcome! 
","Our meeting schedule will be one advanced meeting, two intermediate meetings and two beginner meetings for any given week. Each meeting will be held on days to be determined by club members’ availability.","['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday']",medium,"['programming', 'code', 'ccc']","Relevant links:

The Stuyvesant Research Club,stuyresearchclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyresearchclub/f328982c,The Research Club aims to provide students with a community to explore their scientific curiosities and resources to get involved in research.,"The Research Club provides aspiring student researchers with the resources necessary to transform their classroom knowledge into practical scientific experience. 

Members can choose from different branches of the club to join depending on their specific interests: gaining hands-on experience of lab techniques (general meetings), contributing to a STEM publication (SIGMA), receiving mentorship from an upperclassman to secure an internship in a lab (SRMP), having casual discussions about various topics as part of a podcast (Notation), and managing a website and social media platforms (Web Department). 

General meetings consist of weekly guided experiments that expose students to various biological lab techniques. In workships, members can work on proposals or research for science competitions like Genes in Space. Special events such as symposiums or guest speakers are also occasionally held. Meetings are open to everyone and members are encouraged to, but not required to, attend the weekly meetings.

SIGMA is the Research Club’s magazine, published every 1-2 months. The publication melds STEM and humanities and exposes students to scientific journalism in an accessible format. The publication relies on four departments: the Annotations, Creative Works, Layouts & Graphics, and Revisions departments. The Annotations Department defines terms and summarizes parts of the papers so that they are easier to read. The Creative Works Department writes articles about topics members are interested in. The Layouts & Graphics Department creates all of the graphics and formats the pieces. The Revisions Department makes sure that all the grammar and content is correct; members also write short lab technique reviews. SIGMA members are expected to join 1-2 departments, attend departmental meetings, and complete assignments promptly.

In SRMP, or the Stuyvesant Research Mentoring Program, mentees attend workshops that provide instruction and one-on-one assistance with writing cover letters, resumes, and applications to programs, in addition to helping mentees find their interests and understand what working in a lab entails.

Notation is a podcast hosted by the Research Club. In the episodes, which are released twice a month, members discuss different topics in science, including those that have been covered in past SIGMA articles. Members are expected to independently read about the topic beforehand and contribute to the discussion.

The Web Department manages the Research Club website, updating it with new content as SIGMA is published and working on new features. It is also responsible for updating the Research Club’s Facebook and Instagram accounts with new information, opportunities, and meetings. ","The Research Club benefits Stuyvesant by fostering a community of student researchers with strengths in both conducting research and communicating effectively.

Students will learn how to analyze scientific papers by editing and annotating student-written papers for Stuyvesant’s Research Club Magazine, SIGMA. SIGMA also has a creative works department so members can focus on their own creative pursuits in scientific journalism. 

The club helps students develop and explore their interests in the field of scientific research. For example, the club guides experiments in which students learn how to follow various protocols, how to properly handle lab equipment, and how to interpret data. The club also holds guest lectures from upperclassmen and professional scientists. The lecturers discuss the work they have done in their lab and describe their experience with scientific research. These opportunities allow a student to gain a better understanding of what scientific research entails.

The Research Club helps students brainstorm ideas for scientific competition. In various meetings, students will be given the opportunity to work on completing research papers or project proposals for science competitions, such as Genes in Space. Students are given assistance by the members of the club’s board in addition to the faculty advisor in order to create stronger entries into such competitions. 

The Research Club also has a program specifically designed to mentor underclassmen. The Stuyvesant Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) pairs qualified upperclassmen with underclassmen, who are interested in science research. The program aims to dive deeper into student’s interests for research and secure an internship with a lab. Towards the end of the year, weekly meetings are aimed towards helping students find research opportunities outside of the school, which may include summer research programs or laboratory internships. The Stuyvesant Research Club ultimately helps students who have demonstrated an interest in scientific research but lack the experience or resources to perform research.",stuyresearchclub.com,"The Research Club has various leadership positions to oversee specific aspects of the club as well as editors for the SIGMA publication. Appointment to a position is determined by an application and training period. The applications are open to all freshmen, sophomores, and juniors regardless of their prior experience in the club, though preference may be given to those who have contributed to the club in the past. A portion of the candidates from the application pool are selected for an interview by an interview board which consists of leaders directly involved with the position. After interviews are conducted, the leadership board discusses which candidate to select for training. The selected candidates undergo a training period, during which they work closely with the current leaders of the position they are in training for to gain experience and learn what their responsibilities are. At the end of the training period, if the trainees have performed well and demonstrated the capability to manage their positions’ responsibilities, they are appointed to their position as a leader. Leaders are expected to fulfill their tasks promptly and to communicate with other leaders of the club on a weekly basis. If a leader does not meet the expectations, they are suspended from their position while the leadership board discusses the leader’s performance and if they need to be removed. Most leaders will generally maintain the position that they were in the previous school year with applications released for positions that have an opening. New positions may be added if necessary, based on the suggestions of members of the club and the leadership board.","The Stuyvesant Research Club is the only club that promotes the pursuit of scientific research by providing students from all backgrounds the opportunity to be involved in several different facets that compose the scientific community, such as conducting research or disseminating findings. Students have the chance to learn techniques used by researchers in a welcoming environment, to explore their individual interests by writing articles, to apply their artistic skills to a love for STEM through creating graphics, to delve deep into topics of interest in casual conversations, to continue their exploration of scientific research through internships outside of Stuyvesant, and more!","Research Club general meetings are typically held on Fridays. Each SIGMA department holds a meeting at least once every 2-3 weeks and each department has its own designated weekday to meet that does not overlap with that of other departments. SRMP meetings are held twice a month, in addition to one-on-one meetings with a mentor as needed. Notation recording sessions are every other week.","['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday']",medium,"['rc', 'research', 'biology']","No prior experience is necessary for any branch of the club! We highly encourage anyone who is interested, regardless of background knowledge, to come learn, have fun, and make friends. The Research Club also often has food at general meetings like pizza and munchkins! In the virtual world, you can bring your own treats.

ARISTA - Stuyvesant Honor Society,stuyarista,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyarista/e3f864d7,ARISTA is Stuyvesant High School's Honor Society. The organization's members proudly serve their community through tutoring and service initiatives.,"ARISTA was founded and operates on four pillars: scholarship, leadership, character, and service. As an honor society, ARISTA upholds these values by volunteering in school-wide events (such as parent-teacher conferences and open houses), partnering with external organizations, and tutoring students both inside and outside of school. ARISTA comprises around 175 junior and senior members and around 20 sophomore members through our Sophomore Program. While junior and senior members are required to fulfill both tutoring and events credit requirements, sophomore members must fulfill events credit requirements only. However, sophomore members can tutor students if desired. Applications for both general membership and the Sophomore Program become available in January for current freshman, sophomore, and junior students, and induction into ARISTA occurs in early September. Prospective applicants are required to maintain a minimum overall grade point average of 92, and ARISTA membership will be determined after a thorough review of grades, extracurricular activities, responses to three open-response questions, and a 20-minute-long interview. In addition, ARISTA has three committees: Events & Service, Web Development, and Operations. Rising sophomore, junior and senior ARISTA members can apply to these committees in June. ","ARISTA is a valuable resource to the student body at large, offering study guides, 1:1 peer tutoring, essay editing, and AIS tutoring sessions. Each year, hundreds of Stuyvesant students utilize ARISTA’s resources to gain additional academic support, prepare for exams, review homework assignments, and much more. We hope to make the transition to and journey through Stuyvesant as seamless as possible by showing how rewarding it can be to seek additional help. Members of ARISTA gain invaluable experience volunteering for a variety of organizations across the city, tutoring District 1 middle school students, forming connections with their driven and passionate peers, and giving back to the Stuyvesant community by helping students succeed on an academic and personal level. Moreover, ARISTA’s committee members serve as leaders within the organization, whether it be leading weekly events at a local soup kitchen, overseeing tutoring sessions after school, or adding innovative features to our website, stuyarista.org. ARISTA is not only a benefit to the Stuyvesant community but also to the greater New York City community as well, consistently striving to meet the needs of the city and our student body. Every year, ARISTA continues to add new initiatives and partnerships that expand its impact across diverse communities. ARISTA strives to reimagine and redefine what an honor society can be -- a connected community of thinkers, leaders, and contributing citizens of the world.",https://stuyarista.org/,"The Executive Council (EC) consists of five members: the President, Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Events and Service, Vice President of Web Development, and the Faculty Advisor. The EC is the executive branch of ARISTA, responsible for all of its operations and responsibilities not delegated to other entities, such as managing its committees and overseeing its members. All members of the EC serve one year terms, lasting from induction to the next year’s induction. Each member of the EC is selected by the previous EC with the approval of the Faculty Advisor. In order to make a fair and educated decision, the EC application consists of a written application, a teacher or guidance counselor recommendation, and an interview for as many as all or as few as necessary applicants. All members of the EC and the faculty advisor must be present (either physically or virtually) for all interviews. All members of the EC and the faculty advisor must read all applications. Any selection must be approved by a unanimous vote of the EC and the Faculty Advisor. Moreover, a member of the EC can be removed for due cause (this may include disciplinary actions, sickness, inability to perform his/her duties, etc). To remove a member from the EC, a unanimous vote of the three other EC members must occur. All members of the EC have equal responsibility and no one member can make an executive decision without the agreement of the whole. Different positions exist on the EC so as to provide division of labor to assist the entire EC in completing their many tasks. ","As Stuyvesant’s official Honor Society, serving as a role model for an organization that is an integral part of both Stuyvesant and New York City is a unique opportunity and privilege. ARISTA allows its members to explore a wide variety of tutoring and service initiatives that extend far beyond the borders of Stuyvesant. ARISTA open the doors to making a tangible impact in the community, whether it is teaching Living Environment to an 8th grade class, speaking to senior citizens as part of the Phone Angels program, or tutoring a student from a high school in a different borough. ARISTA strives to make volunteering services accessible, meaningful, and rewarding. ","ARISTA holds at least one general meeting per semester, not including the induction ceremony that takes place in either June or early September.

The meetings and weekly prompts will develop students' skills as artists and writers while giving them the creative empowerment they need to express themselves honestly. Commentary only serves to suggest paths of growth rather than mold an individual's voice to become something it’s not. The club strives to help students preserve and express their individuality by creating an open and trusting environment where everyone has each other's back. The club also encourages members to experiment and try new mediums and genres, stray from their norms, and see both the world around them and themselves in a new light. The Moonlight commits itself to diversity and pushes its members to aspire to greatness. Leaders of this group populate the blog with accessibility and creativity.","The Moonlight allows students to be accepted in a community that extends out from standard school hours. Although it will have regular bi-weekly meetings where members create an artistic or writing piece, these meetings are not mandatory. The club only hopes that its aura will encourage members to create, share, and discuss ideas outside of the classroom and learn to be better thinkers and dreamers. Meetings are just one stimulus to encourage this creativity. The club will send out weekly emails with writing and art prompts with artistic and personal affirmations. Along with sending weekly emails, the Moonlight will also update its Facebook pages. Creative inspiration varies from person to person: great works cannot be hurried, nor can they be born out of obligation to create. There is no maximum bar for the number of submissions each member sends to the Moonlight. From there, the board will work with the writer or artist to edit the piece or pieces for publication. Eventually, all of the writing or art submissions will be published, and every issue will have works from multiple students because everyone’s voices deserve to be heard. 
The Moonlight wants every member to decide their own level of commitment. As a club, we present the resources and community and allow each individual member to choose the path they want to take to ultimately enrich their lives.",https://stuymoonlight.weebly.com/ @stuymoonlight,"The Moonlight has the following positions: co-presidents, vice president(s) of art, and vice president(s) of writing. The previous presidents appoint presidents. Applicants must demonstrate that they are knowledgeable of the rules and customs of the blog. They must also show that they are dedicated to making the club a better place for everyone. The previous presidents choose vice presidents for the work they’ve done for the club. For each respective type of vice president, applicants must show their experience in editing and publishing such pieces.

While we invite over one hundred students to attend our 12-hour hackathon, and one hundred fifty to attend our 24-hour event, we always open our doors to many more than these numbers. Hosting such large events requires the logistical and organizational skills of a cohesive team that is willing to work together to create a spectacular event. The StuyHacks team consists of four departments (Logistics, Marketing, Sponsorships, and Design), which enables us to efficiently streamline our preparation workflow and communicate more effectively about our progress. Furthermore, the purpose of StuyHacks is to provide not only Stuyvesant students, but also students from other schools and institutions with an opportunity to collaborate with peers to create innovative tech projects. There are numerous students throughout the city fuelled by different ideas and interests. When these students collaborate in a space to work on a project, they can create an outstanding product. StuyHacks is here to facilitate this journey by providing mentorship, a place to work together, and a community of diverse, curious individuals.","Stuyvesant has always had a large and thriving CS community. StuyHacks is an organization that enables students to become further immersed in the world of tech and innovation. Our school hackathon is organized by a team of Stuyvesant students, for Stuyvesant students. We prioritize those in our community and make sure to accommodate hackers of all levels of experience. For those in this school who wish to learn more about computer science, StuyHacks acts as an introduction and entryway to other hackathons. In fact, after attending our event for the first time, a majority of attendees go on to participate in larger overnight college hackathons. At our hackathons, we also emphasize the idea of collaboration and teamwork. Many people enter our events without a team and through extensive team-formation sessions, end up forming lasting bonds with teammates and other participants alike. StuyHacks allows students to meet other students with similar interests as them while exploring the reaches of their programming knowledge. Many Stuyvesant students brainstorm and bring to life creative ideas while collaborating during the 12-hour events. As a community, we encourage innovation at StuyHacks and strive to foster a hub where people can apply the programming skills they learn in class to real-life projects. 
StuyHacks also welcomes complete beginners. Those who are still taking Intro to CS or Annual Intro to CS are more than welcome to attend the organization's events. At hackathons, StuyHacks offers introductory workshops and panels, and helps answer any questions they may have about computer science. A team of experienced undergraduate programmers and industry professionals joins our team every year to serve as mentors at our biannual hackathons.",https://www.stuyhacks.org/,"There are two executive directors of StuyHacks who serve at the highest level of leadership and are responsible for managing the department directors, as well as the event as a whole.

Since prior knowledge is not required, we will begin with teaching the fundamentals of blockchain and cryptography and eventually evolve into focusing on technical and complex applications. Participants will also learn about the use cases of cryptocurrency including DeFi, social tokens, tokenomics, gaming/metaverse, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), and NFTs. We will also explore the basic fundamentals of programming languages such as Solidity and Rust. The club also aims to introduce members to the people of Web3 who are active builders, projects that they are working on, and how the field of cryptocurrency is evolving. This will provide members with a better understanding of the current landscape and potential career opportunities in the space.","A Crypto club would greatly benefit Stuyvesant High School as cryptocurrency is becoming more and more pervasive in many aspects of our society–from financial services to the creator economy. Cryptocurrency will continue to revolutionize technology, social media, finance, and many other industries as it allows for fast and safe communication and transactions without the involvement of intermediaries. 

This club will provide several benefits to its participants across three areas: education, access and hands-on learning. First, club members will learn the essential building blocks of the cryptocurrency space. Club participants will be able to define and understand terms such as blockchain, crypto wallets, stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi, Web3, and DAOs. Currently, it is difficult to get training in Solidity and Rust, the building block languages predominantly used in this space. Most developers are self taught or take a cohort based class. As a club, we will explore and learn these languages together.

Club members will also gain access to crypto experts around the world who will speak about various cryptocurrency topics. An added bonus may be potential internship opportunities that our invited cryptocurrency professionals may offer to club members. Lastly, club members will have the opportunity to gain hands-on learning by attending crypto conferences.",,"The President and the Vice President can agree to create new leadership roles for the club, but there will be no more than five leadership positions. Possible leadership opportunities may include positions in marketing and education.

Prior to elections, the President and the Vice President will nominate no less than 5 and no more than 10 candidates for a position. Nominations will be decided based on a club members’ dedication and enthusiasm for the club. If one of the nominees does not want a leadership position, then the President and the Vice President will choose a new nominee. The rest of the club members will vote for the nominee they believe is qualified for the position. 

If a club participant believes a leader is doing a poor job, then the member can consult the other club leaders. If the club leaders unanimously agree, an impeachment procedure will occur. If at least 75% of members, not including club leaders, think that the said leader should be impeached, then the leader will lose their position and become a member. A replacement will be decided by standard election protocol.

The President and the Vice President are not allowed to vote in the elections. Elections will be held virtually through a survey, and the outcome of the election will be announced during the following club meeting. Elections will be held each June.","Although Bitcoin is a pioneer in the field of cryptocurrency, there is a lot more to blockchain technology.

group chat, members will always feel supported, respected, and safe. In the Spectrum weekly meetings, expect to play games, watch funny videos, and connect with
your friends. Also expect to take trips with the club and catch the occasional movie night where you get to vote on the movie! We’re also planning to have some meetings to just chat and make some crafts (clay charms, pride-themed bracelets, etc). Cabinet members are always available to give advice. Additionally, Spectrum organizes events for important LGBTQ dates. For instance, a fundraiser on the national day of silence to honors LGBTQ youth who have been the victims of hate crimes. Joining the club is also a good idea if you want to hear interesting quest lectures on a wide variety of topics, from sexual health to current events to LGBTQ representation in the media. If you wish, you can recommend a potential guest speaker to spectrum leadership. Simply, you should join Stuyvesant Spectrum if you want a chill, low commitment club where you can meet new friends, participate in fun activities and feel like you are making a difference in the Stuyvesant community. Plus, we sometimes have donuts!",,"Spectrum currently has two co-presidents! Vice president(s) will be selected at the beginning of the school year through a process of recommendations and interviews. You can go to Presidents or VPs for advice on any subject, and to let you into the Facebook group or group chat. Other tentative leadership positions include Social Media manager for our future Instagram account, Meeting Coordinator, and Director of Public Relations & Outreach. These would be selected through an application sent out to members of Spectrum. Spectrum cabinet members are expected to be able to defuse conflict and handle when a member is being disruptive. Be aware that cabinet members have no tolerance for bullying of any kind. Additionally, cabinet members will never be absent for more than three meetings in a row, so expect to get to know them very well. If a spectrum cabinet member is absent for 4 weeks in a row, the rest of the cabinet members will vote to decide whether or not they will be impeached. If you are at all interested in joining the spectrum cabinet, simply be friendly! If a spot opens up after cabinet applications have already closed, the existing cabinet members will recommend new members or potential successors based on observed leadership skills and ability to get along with others. At such time, they will be contacted for an interview. Don't worry, the questions we ask are not difficult!","Though great strides have been taken, LGBTQ youth still often feel isolated from their peers and fearful of identity-related harassment. Spectrum is dedicated to ensuring
that no Stuyvesant student ever feels that way. This is a unique, Open space for you to meet other members of the community without fear of judgment. Spectrum is solely
focused on LGBTQ and intersectional issues and how they affect our daily lives, and determined to make Stuyvesant a more supportive, secure place.","Spectrum meets once a week, every Thursday at 4 PM.

Stuyvesant Japanese Media Club,stuyjmc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyjmc/d7867a2d,A chill community brought together by the shared love for Japanese media and hope to learn something new about it.,"The Japanese Media Club’s purpose is to discuss Japanese and Asian media such as, but not limited to: anime, manga, light novels, video games, music, and visual novels. Some members also love writing and drawing characters from these settings. There are meetings after school every Wednesday and Friday. Special meetings will be held to commemorate certain holidays. The club aims to create a casual setting for its members. To that end, members do not need to come to every meeting to be involved with the club. However, while members are not expected to bring anything to the table other than their interest in media from Japan or East Asia as a whole, the club does plan and host events that allow our members to utilize their creative skills to contribute to the overall atmosphere of meetings. There is also an active online community structured similarly to the in-school meetings. Members are freely encouraged to contribute ideas to the club and share their favorite media during meetings or anytime in the dedicated online community.","The Japanese Media Club is a rapidly growing club where members can share their interests with others and learn more about Japanese media. While anime watchers and manga readers are generally shunned by the public and painted in a negative light, this subculture is gaining traction around the world. Japanese and other Asian studios tell beautiful stories worth experiencing, something recognized by publishing companies, consumers, and critics. Due to the club’s laid-back attitude and appreciation of all interests, the non-toxic environment will help members get through the hardships of Stuy life. Along with this, the club’s environment facilitates discussions to cater to those who are passionate about their interest and would like to share them with their fellow club members. As a club by students, for students, the club is built by its participants and every member supports one another academically and emotionally. In addition, the club is great for students taking Japanese class, as it provides a tool, for exploring Japanese media, to help these students learn and appreciate the language. This isn’t limited to just Japan, as the subculture is spreading to the rest of Asia as we often have discussions of other Asian works such as Chinese manhua and South Korean manhwa. The Japanese Media Club promotes a more culturally diverse appreciation of media among Stuyvesant students. We also act as a medium for people to broaden their horizons. Anyone is welcome to join the club at any time they please, even if they have never seen Japanese media before. We want our club members to be exposed to new Japanese media and hobbies they haven’t considered before. ",https://discord.com/invite/RKkcVqt,"When a spot is available, the leaders will open up leadership applications for all members. The club presidents will then read through all of them and decide the best candidate(s) to fill the spot. The quality of the application AND the contribution of the applicant to the club will factor into their decision. Then the most suitable candidates are given interviews conducted by the current council. Their applications, interviews, and activity as a club member will determine who are the new leaders. The chosen member(s) will then be announced and the accepted applications will be shared for full transparency to the rest of the club members. Impeachment happens through in-person voting between council members as soon as a board member abuses their powers, is not working well with others or stops showing up to the club for a month unless they have a legitimate excuse for doing so. Legitimate excuses include having tutoring or being a tutor, SING! commitments, sports with mandatory practices, illness, lots of schoolwork, etc. 75% of council members (all 3 of the remaining council members) will have to be in agreement to impeach a fellow council member.","Our club is unique because it serves as a place where fans of Japanese media can come together and enjoy things, such as anime together after school. Rather than focus only on just doing one thing, we allow and encourage our members to do things outside of just watching anime. We also actively engage with our members when we don’t have meetings to see what people want to do or how they’re holding up in general.",Our schedule is generally Wednesdays and Fridays every week but we may make exceptions for holidays.,"['wednesday', 'friday']",low,"['anime', 'casual', 'japan']",,"Tracy Yang - PRESIDENT

Stuyvesant Road Runners,stuyrr,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyrr/90fe3d36,Stuy Road Runners promotes a healthier lifestyle through recreational running and exercise in a welcoming environment.,"Stuyvesant Road Runners welcomes students who want to stay in shape in a low-commitment club. Students can run or walk recreationally. They may also train for PSAL sports teams tryouts. Stuyvesant Road Runners meets three days a week(Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) during 10th period or after school, but members can choose when they want to come. Members meet at the first-floor lobby where attendance is taken. Afterward, leaders will take members out to the Hudson River where members do various running activities such as endurance runs, sprints, and time trials. Members engage in calisthenic exercises post-run that target their core strength and upper body strength. The last segment of a typical meeting is the cooldown which consists of stretches including but not limited to: piriformis, toe touches, and cobra stretches. Road Runners are encouraged to put their best efforts into runs, walks, and workouts and to run on their own time during week-long vacations. In case the weather does not permit the club to run outside, leaders will conduct aerobic exercises in lieu of the usual outdoor runs. Outside of school, members have the opportunity to participate in races and other events hosted by the New York Road Runners organization. Members also have the opportunity to receive free items such as T-shirts or headbands through their engagement in Road Runners. Dedicated members receive medals that celebrate their efforts and achievements.","Stuyvesant Road Runners advocates for health and fitness because leaders believe that exercise, no matter how little it is, can be both mentally and physically beneficial. Exercise is especially important because students often forget to include physical activity into their schedules. In addition, off-season athletes can make use of Road Runners to prepare for the next season. Students who are not a part of PSAL teams or who wish to commit to a running routine can find many benefits in the Road Runners club; joining a circle of fellow runners and walkers generates encouragement and group effort. While running is not always an easy sport, Road Runners aims to provide continual motivation and support for starting-out or experienced runners. Running is an aerobic exercise that gives great cardiovascular benefits. Post-run workouts consist of a large variety of stretches and calisthenics. Doing such workouts regularly leads to greater strength and muscle fitness. In addition to building running endurance and strength, joining Road Runners is a great way to engage in a community. Members can run with others and motivate each other along the way. There is no shortage of motivation and support, two elements that make running a less daunting sport. Members are also encouraged to drink enough water and make that a lifestyle habit. Road Runners provides a great reminder to look after one’s physical and mental health and is a period to let go of any academic or outside stress.",https://stuyroadrunners.wixsite.com/stuyrr,"At the beginning of the spring semester, current leaders send out an email to the club to announce the release of leadership applications. Members who are interested fill out the attached Google Forms stating their reason for applying and other time commitments. This information, along with commitment and workout participation, will be used by the current leadership to select new leaders. Current leaders meet to review each application and select applicants who will be given an interview. Applicants who are chosen after interviews are leaders-in-training, and they will lead the post-run workouts. New leaders are officially chosen in June. All leaders of the club are expected to lead runs, exercises, and be present at every practice unless they have notified the other leaders in advance. Leaders organize the budget, meeting attendance, and send out emails with updates. In regards to impeachment protocols, members can talk to any of the leaders, who then convene to discuss the issue. If the issue is not resolved by then, leaders will meet with the faculty advisor to discuss further steps. Then the faculty advisor will hold a meeting with all the leaders where the leader who has been neglecting their duties is given a choice to either fulfill their duties or resign from their leadership position. Members are encouraged to attend every meeting and for their safety, members are required to wear the proper attire (e.g. t-shirt, shorts, leggings, sneakers).","Road Runners is one of the few non-competitive athletic activities at Stuyvesant because the club accepts runners at every level. As a chapter of the New York Road Runners organization, members have the chance to participate in city-wide half-marathons and events. Members can also receive T-shirts, sneakers, and other items from the organization as a commemoration of their dedication. Road Runners meets during tenth period and after school, allowing members to maximize their free period if they wish. Leaders help to foster an encouraging environment for everyone and help members set personal goals and work toward achieving them.","We are available Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 10th or after 10th.

Stuy A Cappella,acappella,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/acappella/932b611f,"Stuyvesant A Cappella bands together the talented singers of Stuyvesant's student body, using only voices to create, arrange, and perform music.","Stuyvesant A Cappella is a close-knit group that bands together Stuyvesant's talented voices to create, arrange, and perform music without any instrumental accompaniment! In the first half of the year, we'll choose and sing a handful of holiday songs to help get Stuyvesant in the holiday spirit, involving caroling and performing at the Chorus Winter Concert! Afterward, we take a short break for SING! season, then come together once more to prepare for our Spring Showcase. For the showcase, we've done a wide variety of songs, from ""Rather Be"" to ""My Girl"", and even ""Gary Come Home"" from SpongeBob! We hold auditions during the fall and spring seasons, and absolutely no experience is necessary! As a member, it's expected that you show up at least once a week to learn the music, practice the songs in your free time, and reach out to club leaders whenever problems arise. We encourage any passionate singers or beatboxers to consider being a part of our A Cappella family!

","Stuyvesant A Cappella hopes to foster a safe and welcoming community for any passionate singers and beatboxers in the Stuyvesant community! Through our practice and helping each other learn music, we become a close-knit family that encourages each other to grow as not only musicians, but also as collaborators. Because A Cappella relies solely on our voices, it is pertinent that we hold ourselves and each other accountable for learning and practicing the songs in order to ensure that we can create and perform our music with maximum effort! Because of the size of our group, each voice holds a lot of weight while we're singing, and it is crucial that each person is singing to the best of their ability, which builds self-confidence. Through our music, we strive to bring the Stuyvesant community together and hopefully bring joy to everyone. We also hope to show the Stuyvesant community just how beautiful music can be when it comes from just our voices alone! A Cappella is something that most people have only heard about from Pitch Perfect or Pentatonix but never think that its something they'll ever be able to do, but we hope to encourage the Stuyvesant community to give it a try!
",https://www.instagram.com/stuyacappella/,"For Stuy A Cappella, there are 3 distinct positions: President, Vice President, and Music Director. The president is in charge of reaching out to the administration about events (i.e. caroling, spring showcase), leading and giving feedback during meetings, leading the audition process, and works to make sure that everyone in the club is keeping up with the music and is having fun while doing so! There are typically 1-2 presidents, with seniority in play for this position. The vice president is in charge of working alongside the president to assist whenever necessary in order to ensure meetings run as smoothly as possible. There are normally 1-2 vice presidents. The position typically goes to juniors (so they can learn the duties of being president for their senior year) as well as seniors, but it is also open to any enthusiastic and passionate underclassmen as well. The music director is in charge of arranging music for the group to sing, as well as help lead and conduct while we sing, then give feedback to help us improve. There are normally 1-2 music directors. This position goes to anyone who has a passion and interest in arranging music, no matter their grade! At the end of every year, a leadership application is sent out to all of the members, and anyone who is interested in pursuing a leadership position is encouraged to apply! Then, the people who currently hold leadership positions in the club read over each person's application, then discuss together and decide who will take on leadership roles for the next school year. Presidents, vice presidents, and music directors will be impeached if they are caught breaking club rules (i.e., using nepotism to ensure that underqualified people get into the club, or they don't show up to the majority of meetings.) Then, a vote will be held involving all club members, and if at least two-thirds of the club agrees that the leader is breaking rules, he or she will be voted out.
","Stuyvesant A Cappella is currently the only A Cappella group at Stuyvesant! Although Stuyvesant already has numerous choruses, bands, and orchestras, as well as our own theater community, we are the only club that does not rely on an instrument in order to make music. Rather, we are a small, close-knit group that creates music with simply our voices alone and pride ourselves on the beautiful music that we're able to make and perform without using instruments!

","We typically meet 2-3 times a week, although we decide on days together as a group to ensure everyone can attend at least once a week. We take a quick break during SING! season in order to encourage our members to participate in SING!, then resume meetings once again after SING! season is over.","['tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday']",medium,"['music', 'acappella', 'singing']","

In addition we will work together as a group and create short films. This includes the many tasks involved in creating films such as screenwriting, filming, editing, and so much more. Students can be from all areas of experience. The members are expected to play a role in creating a short film. This means that they should be involved in the creation in at least one way, whether that means helping with writing, props, costumes, cinematography, directing, editing, makeup, special effects, or more. This will be a collaborative process, so members of the club are expected to work together in order to create the short films. The members will discuss and talk to each other and develop teamwork skills. The members don't have to be involved in every aspect of the process, but should be involved in at least one part of the production process.","This activity will help students become more knowledgable about how to work together and make a film.

The Stuyvesant community will also now have a club that caters to some people's specific interests, such as screenwriting, cinematography, and editing. All three of which don't have a club that is dedicated to them. The Stuyvesant community would become more creative and have more of range of activities for students.

The previous leaders can choose to continue leading, or give their place to another student. If one club leader is not doing their duties such as attending meetings, organization, and overseeing then it is possible that they may be impeached. This can be done if one student presents their case to the club members, and when put up to a vote a majority of the students agree that this leader must be impeached.

Members can connect with other players to “queue” with. We also have a community of competitive, high ranked players that can help you improve in your game of choice. We also host tournaments throughout the year to fuel the competitive spirit of the club. Our other goal is to increase the legitimacy of eSports. We have an eSports team for Valorant and League of Legends that gets to compete in a local league known as “EzEsports”, which includes many other familiar high schools.

"Rock the Street, Wall Street",rockthestreetwallstreet,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/rockthestreetwallstreet/1b46f59a,RTSWS is a financial & investment literacy program designed to spark the interest of a diverse population of high school girls into careers in finance,"To close the gender gap in wages, wealth accumulation and in financial professions, we have to inspire girls to pursue the M in STEM, by exposing them to real-life, positive money management role models. RTSWS sparks girls’ interest at a critical juncture in their lives, pre-college planning, and expands their perceptions of what a person who works in finance looks like beyond the traditional stereotypes. 
RTSWS mentors offer college and career path guidance to our students. We are effectively changing the student to guidance counselor ratio from a national average of 482:1 to 2:1. This has a multiplier effect on the career and lifetime trajectories of our students, especially those from underserved schools. Our female volunteers provide social capital to students who otherwise would not be connected to pros in the financial field. Student cohorts are being built among the girls and industry connections are eliminating the barriers to women entering M in STEM professions. Since launching in 2013, more than 3,000 girls have graduated from the year-long program.","RTSWS gets girls re-engaged with the M in STEM, math, at a critical age, when they are on the verge of becoming financially independent; choosing whether or not to go to college; what college they will choose, and which majors/minors they will study.
 
Female financial professionals lead classroom workshops on money management and more during a five-week period. Our cutting-edge, open-sourced curriculum rips from the headlines, discusses public policy, economic policy, and stock and bond markets. Workshops have covered topics from credit card debt to auto financing to blockchain. Hands-on financial projects including lifetime budgeting, spending while in college, allocating paycheck deductions, evaluating company stocks and bonds, stock market updates, salary negotiation, saving, and investing for retirement. Speakers, workshops, and presentations from female financiers and entrepreneurs; field trips to financial services firms, banks, state and corporate treasury departments, entrepreneur centers, and more. Rock The Street, Wall Street engages with the local financial community. We facilitate exclusive connections where possible, providing unique opportunities to participants. As participants, girls have access to this supportive and engaged local network of teachers, mentors, professionals, and fellow students. These bonds extend far beyond the duration of the program, providing participants with lifelong connections and a strong support system to achieve their goals.",https://rockthestreetwallstreet.com/home/,"Student CEOs are the only student leadership positions. Student CEOs are appointed through a three-step process: first, they must ask for a Teacher Recommendation. This Teacher Recommendation must be emailed to RTSWS, along with the applicant’s resume. If chosen for an interview, applicants must interview and await results. Since Student CEOs are a relatively new position, there are no strict rules for the transfer of leadership between school years. One possible procedure entails the same three-step process described above, which will be open to all RTSWS members and current Student CEOs. The Student CEOs work together as a duo.

Members of RTSWS are expected to attend weekly meetings, commit to projects, and partake in field trips. They are encouraged to take advantage of our unparalleled resources. We invite professionals from top firms to mentor students, and we hope students can gain a better understanding of careers while gaining exclusive connections and expanding their networks.

If a Co-CEO is not showing up to mandatory meetings or participating in discussions, they will receive a strike and a warning. Once they amount to three strikes they will be demoted back to general member and we will conduct a new interview search for their replacement. ","RTSWS programs inspire and equip girls with the skills to succeed financially and potentially pursue a career in finance. Girls learn not only about budgeting and spending, (where most financial literacy programs end), they also learn about savings and investments. We do this through classroom workshops led by female financial professionals, coaching, and field trips. We are one of the fastest-growing financial literacy high school programs focusing on just girls, in 2018 we doubled the number of cities where we have programs. RTSWS engages industry sponsors and volunteer instructors to educate students on real-world personal financial management practices, college paths, and career opportunities. We make learning fun by ripping from the headlines, role-playing, hands-on team projects, and exposure to positive money management.

While not being an official leader, members are allowed to teach/ lead some club meetings, as long as they inform the presidents first and show that they have the experience and capability to lead the class. 
","Stuy Pensthetics is the only club at Stuyvesant that focuses on the art of modern calligraphy. Stuy Pensthetics not only explores the art of penmanship but also allows one to expand their knowledge and use their skills for other creative purposes: bullet journalling, penpalling, and more. Stuy Pensthetics is different from other clubs who also allow their members to pen pal in that our club focuses on actual letter pen palling rather than using online pen palling sites to penpal with people from all around the world.
","There will be weekly meetings (meeting days will depend on member availability). This club is low commitment—members can come whenever they can/ want to, but it is recommended that they come to a meeting once a week as this is when the pen pal exchange between club members will occur.

Stuy Pensthetics is open to anyone who is interested in starting and/or learning more about calligraphy. The ‘sthetic’ from the club name stems from the word ‘aesthetics’ and the ‘pens’ has a double meaning: pens as in the writing utensils we use for calligraphy and penpalling, which is something that this club focuses on.

From the most basic identification puzzles to more complex meta puzzles, members will learn how to solve a puzzle from beginning to end. Meetings will be held in person once every 1-2 weeks, and while there will be lessons at the beginning for basics, most meetings will consist of practice puzzles, some of which may span multiple meetings. When official puzzlehunts are hosted, teams will be formed to compete, allowing members to get to know each other better. While participation in these puzzlehunts is optional, it is highly recommended as it is a really fun way to destress. For these, there will be additional meetings, but the times are flexible. Moreover, there will be collaborations with other clubs to publicize puzzlehunting further. Ergo, members will work with each other to write puzzles, with the ultimate goal of creating a puzzlehunt of their own.","Solving puzzles is an activity that has been shown to have a variety of benefits. It helps improve mood and decrease stress by increasing the brain’s production of dopamine. This is perfect for relaxing in an interesting and productive way after an exam or exhausting day. Puzzles are also great for the brain as they reinforce connections between brain cells, boost memory, increase attention to detail, and improve mental speed. In addition to this, it helps with problem-solving skills which are needed every day. Moreover, Stuyvesant students can solve puzzles to relax while collaborating with other members of the community. Solving puzzlehunts (and general problem solving) becomes eye-opening, creative, and exciting when peers share ideas or just simply have fun being together. Not only will this benefit students in the long run in the academic setting, but also in the real world where teamwork is necessary for creative solutions. Puzzlehunting is a team sport! Ultimately, this club aims to have members discover the joy of the “Eureka!” moments in puzzle solving and build lasting bonds through various events. As there are no other clubs dedicated to puzzlehunts, this club would provide a space for those who love puzzles but are interested in a more long term challenge.",https://linktr.ee/stuypuzzlehunts,"There are 2 - 3 leaders for this club. They are tasked with organizing and leading meetings, coordinating Puzzle Hunts, hosting our own Puzzle Hunts, and maintaining any digital documents as well as websites. If a leader leaves the school, applications will open to club members to become the next leaders during the end of the school year. The applications will be read by the current leaders and new leadership will be decided upon. Applicants will be selected based on their activity as well as their contributions. If leaders do not leave the school or the club, leadership will carry over through the school years. In the case that a leader is not doing their job, a vote will be held. In the case of a majority, the leader will be removed and a new one will be chosen. If all the leaders are removed, then a new vote will be held to determine the new leaders.","There are no clubs at Stuyvesant currently dedicated to puzzlehunts. This club is perfect for those who love puzzles, but want something more long-term that they can collaborate with friends on. This club also introduces the Stuy community to puzzlehunting as it’s not very well known. Having a dedicated space for puzzlehunting with peers that can help makes puzzlehunting less intimidating and more approachable. This club will also teach the basics which are the building blocks upon which puzzles are built and serve as a safe space to practice gaining the intuition to solve more complex puzzles.","This club will meet approximately once every two weeks throughout the school year.

Stuyvesant Robotics,robotics,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/robotics/affc6c81,Stuyvesant Robotics consists of 3 student-run robotics teams dedicated to building robots and spreading STEM.,"Stuyvesant Robotics is composed of 3 robotics teams: Stuy Fission Team 310, Stuy Fusion Team 479, and StuyPulse Team 694 . Teams 310 and 479 participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and Team 694 participates in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). The primary purpose of Stuyvesant Robotics is to help cultivate a welcoming environment for students that are interested in STEM and robotics to learn in. New members are taught the basics of Engineering, Software Engineering and Marketing in the first half of the year through the Newbie Education curriculum, organized by veteran members. Once they have the fundamentals down, members then work together as a team to build a robot to compete in either the FIRST Tech Challenge in the winter or the FIRST Robotics Competition in the spring. The teams go on to compete in competitions in the state and beyond. Members go on to spend years on the team, progressing from learning the ins and outs of machines and programming, to leading the design and construction of mechanisms. By senior year, they have become mentors, passing their knowledge and the values of FIRST down to the younger members. ","When new members join the team, they are not only taught the fundamentals of their department—marketing, software engineering, or engineering—but are also instilled with a passion for problem-solving and exploration. On this team, students grow to become leaders who don’t only inspire future members but also spread STEM in their communities. Since its inception, Stuyvesant Robotics has inspired the school to create its first robotics-related classes, allowing students to gain experience in a field often unavailable to high school students. After countless demonstrations at the school's open house, student-led tours know to always stop by, where the teams attract large crowds awed by the robots in action. Many members have joined the team for this very reason. Demonstrations at the school's alumni and parent association dinners also allow the teams to educate and inform students, alumni, parents, school administrators, and local politicians about FIRST and STEM, who in turn help create courses and programs that bring more prospective students into the team, spreading STEM to countless students. With the newly renovated lab that was donated by two generous alumni, Stuyvesant Robotics wants to create more robotics and technology classes and expand resources that can be shares with the community. With an enlarged space and more machines, we’ll invite more local and international teams to practice alongside us and share resources with, a tradition we’ve been building for years.",https://stuypulse.com/ | https://fission310.com/ | https://fusion479.com/,"Each department has a president and vice president, who are elected by the rest of the team at the end of every school year. Members who would like to run for one of these positions must send out a candidacy email to announce their candidacy. On the designated election day, candidates will give speeches, followed by a Q & A period. Students not running for a given position will vote anonymously and may choose to abstain from voting for any given position. The voting process is overseen by a moderator, who is often a graduating student. If a candidate gets the majority vote, they will immediately be appointed. If no candidate gets a majority vote, the top two candidates will go into a runoff. The presidents and vice presidents, or the Executive Council, then appoint directors, who are collectively known as the Appointed Council.The appointed council candidates may send candidacy emails to express interest, but it is not mandatory. Impeachment proceedings for EC/AC are initiated through warnings given by a two-­thirds majority of the EC/AC. The officer in question may defend himself/herself, and a two-­thirds majority of the entire team will uphold the impeachment. Any officers, unless suspended by the faculty advisor(s), may be reappointed at any time by a two-­thirds majority vote of the Elected Members. In the event of an impeachment or in the event that a member of the EC/AC resigns, the position will be filled by a two-­thirds majority vote of the remaining EC/AC. When the position of President of Engineering, President of Marketing, or President of Software Engineering is vacant, his/her Vice President may temporarily fill the position as President until the EC/AC has elected another member of the team to serve as President.","Stuyvesant Robotics is a no-cut team. The club does not restrict membership on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, commitment to other clubs, grade, skill or any other such factors. There are also no prerequisites required for joining the team. Stuyvesant Robotics also takes pride in being a student-run team, which cultivates leadership skills in members. Being both a no-cut team and a student-run team grants underprivileged students the opportunity to develop a passion for STEM and business, as well as cultivate countless useful skills. The team strives to help students develop lifelong skills in not just STEM, but also teamwork, project management, and leadership; the experiences and support students get on this team transcends merely robots.","During the preseason and offseason, we meet about two to three times a week and meetings typically last until 6:30pm. During the Build Season and competition season, we meet up to four times a week including occasion weekend's and have meetings throughout the Mid-Winter break. These meetings can last until 9pm. Meetings occur quite frequently but it is not mandatory to attend every meeting and stay until the end.

The equipment that will be the center of attention will mostly be military equipment which ties into the development of similar equipment but repurposed to be used in the civilian world and vice versa. This equipment we'll be looking at will range from cars to airplanes throughout the decades. We'll be diving into the engineering aspect as well which might get a bit spicy the deeper we dive into more sophisticated technology. Members can expect there to be discussions and lectures during the meetings as we learn about pieces of equipment evolve and expand upon each other. Members are expected to be able to speak and contribute to the conversation that is present at hand each meeting however we will be very lenient with participation.,"The main focus of the Overall Equipment Studies Club is to learn about equipment designs and the engineering behind them as well. Our members from the Stuyvesant community will benefit greatly when it comes to the engineering aspect as many of the students at Stuyvesant High School are STEM focused. This will help prepare students by giving a preview of what they can expect when going into an engineering field that involves equipment that is discussed during our meetings. Even though this won't be a hands-on experience we can still manage to learn without the physical item we talk about in front of us. However, we will try our best to present equipment and even purchase surplus equipment when available to better the learning experience. Another benefit apart from engineering is the historical learning that will take place in our meeting. We will go through the usage of the equipment and why the equipment was brought around and created which is extremely important to understand what circumstances the developers were put in and also can help us realize what circumstances we can end up in if we ever decided to go down the road of an engineer that takes a job in the field that we'll go over.",,"The leadership positions will primarily be going from the president, vice president, and then members however we can continue to expand depending on the situation. The idea is that the club won't really have much of a hierarchy since it will be more or less like a lecture and discussion based meeting to share ideas and build off each other. There is no real specific protocol members are expected to follow other than the standard code of conduct given by the school. The policy for transfer of leadership will be voting based or volunteer based thing since it will be an overwhelming task. The leader will have to create slides to help share information to the rest of the group to start off the discussion. Leaders can be removed via voting, the voting will be held unanimously to ensure that people don't abuse the system and force their way into positions. ",What makes our club unique compared to others is that we will be doing something that no other club does. We will be looking at designs that aren't looked at in other clubs under the STEM tag or any other tag. Another thing that makes us unique is that as we go into the engineering aspect of equipment we will also go into the historical aspect which would help us with the engineering aspect of the whole club. ,"Our schedule will be based off of what members prefer and we can be flexible with it, just expect meetings to range from 3-5 a month.","['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday']",medium,"['equipment', 'military', 'history']",,"Euan Chung - President

Photography Club,photographyclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/photographyclub/a3d09283,"The Stuy Photography Club aims to be an outlet for all interested in photography, whether a beginner or a professional.","The Stuy Photography Club is a creative community that aims to bring together passionate photographers at Stuyvesant—both beginners and advanced. Through our meetings, everyone will be able to master the basics of digital photography: aperture, shutter speed, ISO, interpreting histograms, and white balance. Students will also be taught how to edit using Adobe Lightroom to develop their own editing style and understand the different aspects that make up an image: saturation, clarity, tone, and sharpness. They will also learn about the history of photography and explore the work of famous photographers such as Cindy Sherman and Ansel Adams. On top of that, club members will inspire and learn from each other as they work together on monthly challenges and tasks that will be displayed on our website and in school: be it noir portraits, street photography, or fall colors - oranges, yellows, etc. After given a theme, students will venture out into the city on their own to complete the challenge. Then they will participate in group critiques and receive helpful feedback on their work. This process will help club members find their own voices and develop their styles. These pieces will amount to a yearly exhibition that shows their progress and artistic development.","Stuyvesant’s renewed Photography Club will continue to provide and help Stuyvesant students with a passion, question, or interest in photography to find a structured and creative outlet for their work. Through monthly challenges, we hope to engage members and challenge their creativity in exploring photography through various prompts, styles, and ideas. In addition, our peer review system for reviewing submissions will help foster relationships amongst the group, as well as helping each other to develop and identify photo styles unique to each member. When monthly challenge submissions are due, members sit round-table and discuss what they love about member submissions, as well as constructive and light critiques on potential future improvements. In addition, fun icebreakers and group in-school challenges will help club members to make new friends easily and have fun while exploring their passions. As students explore props, cameras, and applications together, their shared struggle and success will help foster friendships and an experience to relax and wind down, laugh and learn, or get a little competitive depending on the meeting planned. Photography Club members will also be able to use their challenge photos to build a creative portfolio and even decide whether they want to pursue a career in the arts, film, or photography. Lastly, with the Photography Club being a gateway for many to discover their love for photography, the club can also help spawn new photographers for Stuyvesant’s Spectator and other publications, as well as for school events as well as external affairs. ",instagram.com/stuyphotography,"There are a few leadership positions that the Stuyvesant Photography Club has. The two club presidents manage and coordinate the majority of club activities and events such as meetings, monthly challenges, exhibitions, etc. They also manage the financial side of things and send out emails regarding any updates or announcements. The club also has a social media manager that manages the club’s social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.They are responsible for keeping track of the engagement on each platform and sending out any updates and announcements through them. As long as they are active in the club, all members are eligible to apply for any leadership positions in the club. As the second semester of the school year begins, the presidents send out a Google Form with questions such as “What position are you applying for?” and “What makes you a good leader?” which will help decide who is suitable for the future leadership positions. The presidents will then decide who will move on to the next stage of leadership applications, in which the members will be interviewed by the current presidents. The presidents will then appoint the leaders-in-training, who will then take over their positions the following school year. For impeachment procedures, if any board member receives a complaint that complaint will be discussed with both they who made the complaint as well as the rest of the board. If the board votes 3 out of 4 (majority vote) to impeach on those grounds, then the board member will be impeached. ","The Stuyvesant Photography Club is very casual, and it does not require too much commitment. The club is fun and relaxed, but the members still get to learn from each other during every single meeting. Looking at everyone’s photos individually and discussing them as a group makes the club extremely engaging, while also allowing the opportunity for members to learn from each other and strive to improve. The club is unique in the fact that it revolves around the idea of learning and being inspired by other club members and encouraging them to push their creative limits.","Our meeting schedule is set for every other Friday, in which meetings are used to review challenge submissions and for fun, in-school missions or learning new techniques and styles.",['friday'],medium,"['photo', 'camera', 'photography']",,"Joyti Nath - President

upstuycle,upstuycle,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/upstuycle/5d722f12,"Upstuycle is for lovers of fashion and crafting who want to exercise their creativity in a sustainable way.
","The thrill that comes with buying clothes, room decor, or jewelry pales in comparison to the exhilaration that comes with hand-making a new item out of something you already own. Upstuycle seeks to help every Stuyvesant student experience this feeling and be able to utilize their own creativity to make upcycled pieces they are proud of. Crafting and making clothes or jewelry can seem really daunting, but through guided step-by-step tutorials, each member is guaranteed to create gratifying, one-of-a-kind pieces they would never be able to find at any store. Each meeting will consist of one activity, which will range from thrift-flipping to creating art from scrap paper to turning tin cans into pencil organizers. The possibilities are honestly endless. Members can suggest future activities through a suggestions inbox, and will also be able to vote on which activity they’d want to complete preceding each meeting. Any activity that is chosen is guaranteed to be inclusive, exciting, and, of course, eco-friendly. Members are encouraged to join as many meetings as possible, but since each meeting offers a new activity, there is no need to worry about missing information from any one session. Emails detailing the activity which will be completed will also be sent out before each meeting so that the proper materials can be scouted from around each member’s home. In addition, everyone is welcome to send in pictures of their projects to be featured in a collective online gallery. Overall, upstuycle is dedicated to helping each member make the most of their creativity in ways they might not have considered before, all the while limiting their environmental impact.
","The general consensus among Stuyvesant students is that climate change is a massive problem, but the actions that we can actually take seem limited, inconceivable, or both. We really don't have much power in how many cars are on the road, how much of the energy we use is renewable, or how much plastic gets recycled each year, but one thing we can control is our own consumption. Consumerism encourages shopping for unneeded items for pleasure, but ultimately, the more unnecessary shopping that occurs, the more the environment suffers. Upstuycle offers a way for the Stuyvesant community to leave a greener footprint by showing how exciting, sustainable, and fun upcycling can be. Students can spend more time exploring their creativity and less time sending plastic into landfills or supporting unethical brands. They may even declutter their homes in the process! In the distant future, upstuycle can even expand its reach and use trash items found at school to create art, making Stuyvesant a brighter and greener place. There are so many benefits that being a member of upstuycle will bring a Stuyvesant student, and after every meeting, they’ll feel like they’ve helped the environment just a little bit, given a piece of trash or old clothing new life, taken the next step in developing their own style, and have made a new one-of-a-kind piece the world has never seen.
",linktr.ee/upstuycle,"There are three leadership positions that must be filled at any given time: President, Vice President and Secretary. Those who are in positions of leadership will remain in these positions until they either choose to resign or graduate. If a change in leadership takes place, applications will be made available to all members interested in the open position(s) at the end of the school year. The current leaders will carefully review each application and take a vote to elect the new leader(s). Leaders are expected to attend at least two-thirds of a club’s meetings per year. If any leader is found to be displaying unethical or malicious behaviors, either inside or outside of upstuycle, or a general display of disinterest in its activities, they will be asked to resign. If they refuse, they may be impeached by a 50% vote from all members. Should this occur, the position of President will be assumed by the Vice President, and/or the position of Vice President will be assumed by the Secretary. If the position of Secretary is left unfilled, an application will be sent out to all members and the responses will be reviewed by the President and Vice President, who will work together to make a fair decision. Additional roles such as Social Media Manager and Website Designer may be opened up once regular meetings begin, and every member will be encouraged to apply. Again, the leaders will elect their choice for each position. For general members, attendance is encouraged but not mandatory, and respect both from all is expected at every upstuycle meeting.
","Stuyvesant offers very few clubs that are dedicated to crafting or fashion, or that work to help the environment. Upstuycle combines both of these into fun and creative activities. The average student wouldn’t pick up a piece of scrap paper or old sock and be struck with inspiration for how to make it into something new, but joining upstuycle would encourage them to do so on a regular basis, even outside of club meetings. Finding potential in “useless” things is a very useful skill that requires a lot of creative thinking, and creativity opens up the mind to innovation in every single aspect of life. 
","Upstuycle's meetings will occur between three and four times a month, and the meeting day will be set once availability has been gauged. For now, it is tentatively set to Thursday. Since new activities are introduced every meeting, attendance is always optional, but the more meetings attended, the more projects created.",['thursday'],low,"['fashion', 'environment', 'crafts']","To keep up with weekly updates from upstuycle’s leaders, click “Request to Join” on this StuyActivities page, follow our Instagram, and join our Facebook group!

Through this club, we aim to aid students in learning different coding languages, giving them the basic knowledge and the opportunity to express their creativity. Primarily, we focus on live coding music using popular programming languages such as Java, Ruby, C++, Python, and JavaScript. We will be using libraries/platforms such as Sonic Pi, Super Collider, TunePad, and EarSketch etc., which will provide our members with tools to compose and perform their own songs with no prior coding experiences needed to become the next big music producer. Programming is also a form of music production and performance using electronic devices and computer software. These musical sounds are created through live coding, a performing arts form and a creativity technique centered upon the writing of source code and the use of interactive programming in an improvised, artistic way. Our club focuses on code-based music creation and performance, which teaches students computing, music theory, and heavily encourages students to have confidence in their coding ability. Students can also engage in various coding projects that includes developing websites, games, and songs to showcase their programming skills and apply their knowledge. Participating in Stuyvesant Coded Beats will give members a wider range of uses from their coding endeavors. ","Our hope for Stuyvesant Coded Beats is to unlock the hidden talent of the programming and music community and help fuel that talent through the club, allowing our members to really harness their creativity and imagination. Our lessons will provide students with basic knowledge of coding and music theory to allow them to create their own music and run their own activities, introducing functions, parameters, loops, variables, syntax, rhythmic note values, song structure, song composition, and other useful skills for those looking for a future career in programming music or live coding. Live coding is a type of improvisational programming, a fusion of performing arts and interactive programming, is a creativity technique, including sound and image based digital media, lighting, improvised computer music, etc. By joining Stuyvesant Coded Beats, students of all different levels of coding knowledge, even ranging to complete beginners, will be able to explore their interest in music programming, gain new ways of experiencing sound and music, and also see their talents shine. This club introduces students to both coding concepts and music theory, allowing them to learn the science behind music and sounds, leading them through the process of using computer programs to code and perform their own songs. No prior experience is required for students to join us since we will cover all the basic programming concepts, the fundamentals of music production/composition and live coding, as well as all the learning resources for students to start from scratch.",Messenger: https://m.me/j/Abbt4hn6M6cNoAw8/      Discord: https://discord.gg/36VJEz8x,"Leadership applications will be released depending on the availability of roles and near the end of the school year. The appointment protocols for leadership positions will be decided through a written application and votes within the board of directors.

The president is selected based on their knowledge of music programming and live coding, commitment to the club, and ability to perform their duties. Education department is responsible for making lesson slides, presenting them to new members, helping organize lessons, managing all the lesson materials, and teaching live coding & music. The coordination department is responsible for event planning, networking, and schedule meetings. They are also in charge of recruiting new members, making and distributing posters/flyers, managing social media accounts, as well as promoting our club. Department leaders are expected to have prior experience with the tools necessary to perform their tasks and will be elected based on their skills and commitment. Education department will be split into coding and music sub departments, students can join departments they are interested in. The education department will also be split into beginner and advanced groups. Beginners are mostly composed of new members or members who do not have prior knowledge about live coding and music. The advanced group is composed of leaders in training from all departments. Beginners will be taught by leaders in training, who will be taught by department leaders. Leaders in training will direct their own groups within the department and report to the directors of departments. Department directors will report to the president who oversees the entire club. Impeachment of any role is determined based on a 3/4 majority vote within management. ","Simply memorizing the syntax and learning how to apply the algorithms can be boring and less engaging. Stuyvesant Coded Beats would be the first to bring coding and music together in an interactive and engaging way, as well as allowing artists to code, coders to express themselves in performance art. The process of writing source code is visible through projecting the computer screen in the audience space, with ways of visualizing the code, providing engaging experience for both the live coder and the audiences. The club provides a friendly bonding environment to support creative musical expression through computer coding and programming. Students are able to explore their passion, engage in experiential learning, practice problem-solving skills, and work creatively/collaboratively with others sharing the same interest.

No prior experience is required at all! Meetings will occur after 10th period and usually take place on Fridays, but meetings may occur any day of the week. Members are expected to sign up for a Recreation Center Membership (which is free). We usually go to the Chelsea Recreation center where activities will take place. Activities can range from weight lifting, basketball, ping pong, and pool. Club members are expected to adhere to recreation center rules: be respectful to others, don't use a machine for too long, etc. Members may stay there for as long as they want but must leave before the recreation center closes. Due to current circumstances, members are expected to mask up at all times and socially distance when possible. Members are also allowed to bring their own equipment to the recreation center such as basketballs, table tennis paddles, etc.","Stuyvesant High School students are often described as stressed, depressed, and overwhelmed, and this isn't too far from the truth. Students are often too busy studying to do anything that they truly enjoy. Recreational Sports Club allows for students to engage in physical activities that they enjoy and make friends along the way. Studies have shown that regular exercise and working out releases chemicals called ""endorphins'' and it acts as a natural antidepressant. We also want students to set goals for themselves other than academics to balance their lifestyles. Recreational Sports Club seeks to create a positive environment where students encourage each other to better themselves and help each other achieve their goals. Working out and achieving goals helps students build confidence that will help improve their lifestyle overall. Recreational Sports Club also encourages students to try out new activities that they have not done before like weight lifting or playing table tennis; and hopefully, students will enjoy such activities and pursue them as hobbies. During quarantine, many students were not able to exercise as regularly as they should, and Recreational Sports Club seeks to reintroduce students back into a healthy lifestyle by encouraging exercise.

Some protocols that we expect members to follow are to not be toxic and try to be respectful to the other members.

Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers(Girls),stickyfingersgirls,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stickyfingersgirls/fe1175bf,"The Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers (Girls) bring Ultimate Frisbee to the Stuyvesant community, allowing players to compete in games in and out of the city.","Representing Stuyvesant High School, the Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers team compete in Ultimate Frisbee games in and out of the city. Members often practice on fields in Upper Brooklyn and travel out of state to tournaments and competitions. No prior experience is necessary because the team teaches new players the basics, from throwing a disc to movement on the field. Ultimate Frisbee heavily emphasizes team spirit: from handlers moving the disc, to cutters advancing it forward, to sideline calls providing guidance to players on the field, the teamwork involved in the sport is critical. As beginners practice and develop more skills, they will be exposed to more advanced levels of play. The people players make bonds with on Ultimate are not just limited to the sport and school: they will be your friends outside of the field as well! Come pick up a disc and join this tight-knit community of athletes! 

Joining Ultimate requires a commitment to work hard! Showing up to most, if not all, practices is a good indication of your commitment. Members are expected to purchase a pair of cleats if they are committed to playing Ultimate Frisbee. They are also recommended to have a disc on them (the team will provide a team disc if players do not know where to purchase it). This way, players can practice throwing the frisbee outside of practice as well.
","The Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers community is open to all people who are interested in the sport, regardless of sex, gender, race, skill level, background and athleticism. We offer students a break from a stressful school life, and let members play in a competitive but fair and positive environment. By emphasizing the spirit of the game, sportsmanship, teamwork, communication, and respect, we grow together as teammates, players, and individuals. As players’ dedication to the team grows, they will form close relationships with members from both the girls’ and boys’ teams, and even with players outside of Stuy. Through tournaments, players will be pushed both physically and mentally, and will meet people from different states that equally love the sport. Members will even be able to see professional players and be taught by them. Again, the team teaches all players everything they need to know - how to throw and catch a frisbee, the game logistics, and even things as simple as relearning the best running posture - at the beginning of the school year to prepare them for game season in the spring. As a beginner-friendly sport, the Sticky Fingers provides everyone in the Stuyvesant community with a chance to relieve their stress while also playing a fun sport. Ultimate Frisbee does require a lot of commitment, but players within the community are exposed to many benefits that outweigh this con. The commitment requirement will also push students to better manage their time and balance all of their activities alongside school. After all, the Sticky Fingers community is always willing to help new players adjust to Stuy!
",linktr.ee/stuygirlsulti,"The girls' Ultimate Frisbee team typically has two senior captains and one junior captain or one senior captain and two junior captains. Coaches and the previous year's captains choose seniors and juniors to fulfill this role through discussion. Factors that are considered for potential captaincy include dedication to the sport and team and leadership skills. The chosen candidates are asked if they accept the title as the next year's captains, and if they do, all three captains are announced at the beginning of the year. Impeachment is also done through discussion between the coaches and the other captains. If the offending captain demonstrates poor leadership, a lack of dedication to the team, or offending/improper behavior, they will be given a warning at first. If the offending captain continues to showcase improper behavior and poor leadership, the coaches and the other captains will remove the offending captain from their position and choose a new captain to fulfill the role.
","The Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers are always open to new members who are interested in playing the sport. Ultimate Frisbee emphasizes “Spirit of the Game,” which means that players resolve conflicts on the field with each other (that's right, no referees!). The community is determined to create a positive and fair playing environment for everyone, ensuring that everyone has fun playing the sport, regardless of the score. To enforce this, the team emphasizes the rules of the game, but above all else, good sportsmanship and respectfulness to themself, each other, other teams, and the environment.
","Previously, the Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers have met 3 times a week (Mon, Wed, and Sat) to practice throughout the year. During the Spring season, the team would meet up to play games against other teams in the city. Most out-of-state games would be on holiday weekends. This year, the captains will try to follow this schedule, but special attention to members’ availability will be kept in mind.","['monday', 'wednesday']",medium,"['frisbee', 'ultimate', 'ssf']","While both the girls’ and boys’ team have the same name, the Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers (girls) are a separate team and have a different playing style from the boys’ team. However, the girls’ and boys’ team will definitely overlap and meet in social settings and tournaments. This year especially, the captains are determined to create more opportunities for players from both teams to socialize and get to know each other better.

Members will be writing poems and reading them out loud during meetings, with every member bringing to the group their personal interests, perspectives, and emotions. Writing workshops will introduce new forms of poetry, including free verse, sonnet, haiku, ballad, and sestina. Similarly, discussion groups will allow members to give and get advice from one another. Members are expected to actively contribute during meetings, providing an insight into the inner workings of their minds. At the end of each semester, an anthology with each writer’s chosen poem, as well as an artist’s statement documenting the thought process, will be shared with the school in the form of a pamphlet and posted on eligible social media. The staff of The Poetry Hub are actively dedicated to fostering curiosity, collaboration, cooperation, and communication to enrich the appreciation of the world in an ever-stressing Stuyvesant environment.","During an ever-growing emphasis on STEM fields in the contemporary world, The Poetry Hub fosters the ability to explain and refine students’ ideas to others and themselves in a creative literary manner. Through promoting young poets to keep developing their literary skills, The Poetry Hub cultivates emotional growth, develops critical thinking skills, and improves performance within (and outside of) Stuyvesant classrooms. Members of the club will learn how to write in different styles of poetry, as well as how to develop their own poetry style through various writing workshops. Students will explore how to write free verse, rhymed poetry, narrative poetry, haikus, tankas, sonnets, odes, limericks, ballads, soliloquies, villanelles, pantoums, and many more styles. In the process of exploration, writers may gain inspiration for their own poems and combine their newly attained knowledge with their own skills. Writing poetry will also allow for members to freely express their emotions in the form of literature. The Poetry Hub can serve as an emotional outlet for members, while simultaneously improving their writing skills. In conjunction with writing and editing poetry, members will have the opportunity to read out their poems and verbally review works, building their confidence. Through repeated practice of reading poetry out loud, members of The Poetry Hub will improve their speaking skills and gain more experience in talking to an audience. In an attempt to help students get out of their own comfort zone, members will address the culmination of emotion in poems characterized by rhyme, repetition, improvisation, and wordplay.",https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.hub.stuy/,"The key leadership positions in The Poetry Hub include the President, Co-President, Secretary, and Treasurer, providing all members with equal opportunities to be an executive in the club. The President and Co-President are expected to lead club meetings, have goals and writing workshops prepared for each meeting, and work alongside members to settle any disputes. Both presidents should clearly communicate with one another to minimize mutual absences, help members as needed with writing projects, provide mentorship in small groups or one-on-one as requested, and perform any necessary outreach for the club. The Secretary will be responsible for keeping all poems in a safe archive, working together with the other leaders in creating and editing the pamphlet, and updating the club’s social media in collaboration with the Presidents. Lastly, the Treasurer will manage all funding needed and used by The Poetry Hub, especially pertaining to printing the pamphlets at the end of each semester. New leadership positions are appointed by the previous leaders and members must have demonstrated a level of commitment by coming to meetings, engaging in writing poetry and attending poetry workshops, as well as showing involvement in the pamphlet that will be produced at the end of each semester in order to be applicable. Leaders must discuss and vote on who they deem are most fit for the leadership positions before appointing new roles. Applications for the following school year will become available during the Spring semester. Finally, if a leader violates the Clubs & Pubs Rules and/or abuses their leadership position, they will receive up to two warnings before they will be removed from the position. Board members are expected to maintain good academic standing (80+ average) and are expected to step down from their position when their schoolwork takes priority. Warnings and removal of a leadership position apply to all positions and will be decided based on a vote by the other current club leaders.","The Poetry Hub is the only poetry club in Stuyvesant, allowing free-spirited members to embrace the mutual interest of self-expression within the literary community. Despite the fact that writing is often such a solitary act, there is no escaping the fact that poets need support to continue their craft. Poetry in itself is an exceptional craft, bringing a reader to the context of real-life experiences in the community and inspiring growth in writing or personal character.","The Poetry Hub will meet biweekly on Tuesday throughout the school year, although meetings may be more frequent closer to the publication of the anthology of our chosen poems.

STEMinism is an organization that works to close the gender gap by connecting high school students to young aspiring female scientists in grades 6-8. High school students will act as mentors for these younger girls and teach them various subjects ranging from biology to computer science. General members will be connected with younger students and hold weekly one-on-one mentoring sessions through zoom that will last approximately 30-45 minutes. Members can choose which topic(s) they would like to tutor in and will be matched with a mentee that wants to learn that subject depending on the schedules of both the mentor and mentee. Nonetheless, STEMinism is more than a tutoring program. It’s an opportunity to make a difference in a student since essentially, the STEMinism mentors are their role models. As a part of this organization, members are not only expressing their passion for STEM, they are also fighting the prominent gender disparity that exists today.","Stuyvesant is one of the most reputable STEM schools in the nation. STEMinism is an organization that will allow Stuy’s students to act as mentors and share their passion for the sciences with female students interested in these topics. STEMinism’s mentors are motivated individuals who will encourage girls to pursue careers in a field that has historically been male-dominated. Students are able to fight social injustice while teaching the subjects that they love. With that said, STEMinism also fosters a welcoming and supportive environment for girls in STEM and is a great place for Stuyvesant’s students to make new friendships with people that share their goals and ambitions. This program strengthens student’s responsibility and leadership skills as they take on the role of a mentor, friend, and role model. It enhances the communication and teamwork skills of our members as they work together to develop a flexible curriculum. As a part of this program, mentors are giving back to their community by educating the next generation of students and combatting unequal representation in science related occupations. To summarize, STEMinism encourages Stuyvesant’s female students to go into STEM related fields and bridge the gender gap through impactful mentorships for younger aspiring scientists.",Instagram: @steminism.stuy ,"Leadership applications will be sent out early in the year and roles will be appointed to the applicants that the board decides demonstrate the most interest and passion. If the current president/vice can’t serve the following year, they will choose who the next president/vice will be with input from current club members. If someone believes that a member in a leadership position isn’t pulling their way and is doing an ineffective job, they may fill out an anonymous survey and the board will decide if the person in the leadership position should be voted out of that position. General members are expected to meet with their mentee every week during their scheduled time. Members who can’t meet with their mentee need to let the board members know at least 3 days in advance. Members are responsible for organizing their teaching material beforehand. Members can teach in a variety of topics and may be matched to different mentees if they wish to teach more than one topic.","STEMinism is currently the only club that combines the ongoing fight against social injustice with a passion for STEM into a mentoring program that connects high school students to younger middle school students. Most young women that want to go into STEM are intimidated and discouraged by the fact that the fields they want to go into are male dominant and STEMinism works to reverse that.

General members will work to help create 3D models, handmade visuals, and slides which will then be used to conduct in person or virtual presentations and lessons at various elementary schools all across the city. Not only are members working to teach the next generation of scientists, we are also learning as well. As members research into the topics that are taught, they acquire an in-depth understanding of the topics and also acquire valuable skills such as communication and leadership. Aside from YSI’s academic and educational aspect, this program also has a strong service factor. Members give back to their community as they improve the education spectrum of those who’re younger than them and strive to increase the exposure of biology in younger students.","Stuyvesant is one of the best schools in the nation and is notorious for its exceptional STEM programs. With the Youth Science Initiative (YSI) we will visit schools from all boroughs and possibly introduce kids who might never hear of Stuyvesant to our school. YSI also enriches their knowledge of science which is one of the fundamental topics upon which Stuyvesant is built on. We will not only help brighten their future, but also provide Stuyvesant with passionate and driven students, working hard to pursue their careers. Since most of the Stuyvesant community are interested in STEM related topics, this club will help bring students together with one common goal, to inspire future generations to pursue STEM careers and further their own. YSI creates a welcoming community that curates curiosity and inspiration. It not only benefits students academically, it is also a great place for students to form new bonds and friendships, which helps students socially and mentally by alleviating stress. This club also helps students formulate skills like communication and teamwork which are necessary for success in future jobs and careers. Furthermore it gives kids in Stuyvesant a chance to assume the “teacher” role and can help them determine if they too are passionate about STEM or not. Students are so used to a textbook based learning model that providing them with a way of learning that makes them the teacher would help them understand subjects in a new and more in-depth way. Youth Science Initiative is most definitely an extremely rewarding experience because it helps students grow in all aspects, both academically and socially.",,"Activity Appointment: To ensure that all appointed leaders are capable of playing their part, we will conduct interviews for those who wish to apply for a leadership position (social media manager, secretary, etc).

We will then issue an anonymous poll for the rest of our members to decide if that said person should be removed from their position. All members should attend the meetings that occur every week. Each member is allowed 3 excused absences per month but they should let us know at least 2 days beforehand.

","We strive to advocate for the hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide who suffer from uncommon diseases. Such diseases include, but are not limited to, Cystic Fibrosis, Hemophilia A, Dercum disease, and hundreds of others. We believe that just because a disease is considered “rare,” it does not mean that the affected individuals deserve less attention from the public or media. Many of these diseases strip away an individual's voice. Therefore it is important for those of us who have a voice to speak up and advocate for our peers who do not. We plan to raise awareness by creating a monthly publication educating people about a specific disease. The publications will be filled with color and aesthetic visuals for easy comprehension and long user engagement. We plan to present these publications in school wide events, such as the annual Health Fair. Also, we plan to post each of our monthly publications to our social media platforms to reach the broader, online community.

","As students in Stuyvesant, many of us love learning biology. We love the gene sequences, protein-making, and countless other topics that we have learned in class. However, we mostly only learn how things are supposed to function. We rarely learn what happens to individuals who don't have perfect working protein makers or those who have a mutation in one of their chromosomes. Even when we do learn the common diseases, we aren't able to further apply ourselves and help speak up for those individuals who have had their voices stripped from them. Not to mention that oftentimes the only way we apply our knowledge in class is on a test.

Stuy Current Events,current-events,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/current-events/8f1d9c5a,"Stuy Current Events will serve as a space for students to discuss politics, current events, and the news. ","The primary purpose of Stuy Current Events (SCE) is to create a welcoming atmosphere for students who are interested in politics or simply wish to be more aware of what is happening around them and have more control over their lives. Politics is not just limited to what affects Stuyvesant, but also includes decisions and events that affect our nation and those globally. As members of SCE, you are expected to show respect for others’ opinions even if you disagree and share your own thoughts and feelings on the matter being discussed. To create good habits in engaging with news, before each meeting members should do some general research about any article or piece of news they wish to share with the club. The first few minutes of club meetings will be dedicated to this. This helps build research skills that will help students in everything from classes to future discussions. ","SCE benefits Stuy through informing the student body of current events and issues that are going on. SCE helps to create civically-minded individuals through developing its members’ leadership and public speaking skills as members discuss and actively seek out knowledge and updates about the news and what is happening around them. Through discussion, members will be able to expand their worldview, see multiple perspectives, and learn from others regardless of whether or not they have the same beliefs and or come from the same background. Discussion in our clubs will take the form of fishbowl discussions with guiding questions, a full out debate with members taking sides, or four corners. Through actively seeking out the news, members will be able to understand the current economic, social, and political problems of our current society and will be encouraged to seek change. As part of SCE’s bimonthly meetings, there will be lessons dedicated to developing skills like finding credible sources, avoiding misinformation, etc. We hope these skills will be reflected in our members’ daily lives, which includes in classes, future voting decisions, and discussions with others. Overall, SCE is a space where students with varying degrees of knowledge on current events, especially those who have little to no knowledge, can learn to research for themselves, expand their knowledge of the world, and form their own educated opinions. 
",,"Leadership positions include President, Vice President, and Social Media Director. The President and Vice President are responsible for organizing, planning, and maintaining meetings. Additional responsibilities include leading discussions during meetings, guiding conversation, gathering resources for members to read up on current events, and most importantly, fostering a safe and welcoming environment. Responsibilities for Social Media Director include designing posters to advertise meetings, managing social media accounts (including the Facebook group and Instagram), and generally advertising the club to the student body. The Vice president will become President the following year. Members discuss who will be the next Vice President at the end of the year based on their perception of the candidates’ leadership skills, participation, and commitment. The elected Vice President will then choose who to be Social Media Director. Members are expected to have an open mind and show respect for others and the discussion. Additional responsibilities include regular attendance and participation during meetings, which is crucial to the SCE learning process. If a leader misses too many meetings, misses three meetings without prior notice, greatly offends someone, produces hate speech, he or she will be impeached through a discussion with the leadership board and a majority vote within the club. If a leader is impeached twice, their position as leader will be removed. 
","Stuy Current Events is unique in offering a space for discussion over the news, which is important for developing our worldview. It’s especially unique in its open discourse format, with the opportunity to freely discuss a range of topics. In SCE, members become more informed through seeing different perspectives on issues and have a chance to explore other people's interests in current events. SCE encourages members to branch out of their comfort zones and discuss topics that may be difficult to talk about. SCE is an accessible space, and anyone can join regardless of any prior knowledge and expertise on politics! SCE is a place for members to learn and grow together!

Stuy Guitar,Guitar,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/Guitar/31a61873,Stuy Guitar aims to provide the opportunity to learn about art of guitar playing. ,"Stuy Guitar is a hub for anyone interested in learning guitar. Members can share or discuss their musical experiences. And explore countless guitar styles through various techniques and concepts. Meetings are in the form of lessons, practice sessions, or performances. Members are encouraged to attend meetings. But, meetings aren’t mandatory unless during special occasions. We offer practice sessions remotely during any form of break. Members are strongly encouraged to purchase guitars, which will be covered in lessons, allowing for convenience. Members may vote on the type of guitar techniques or concepts they want to learn. They may also suggest songs they want to cover during meetings. (More Info in Interest Form) Otherwise, members are to undergo systemic training in guitar and musical fundamentals. We expect members to be respectful to each other and the environment. The purpose of this club is to provide a learning environment for students interested in learning guitar. Note: basics are necessary before further suggestions. 
","Stuyvesant High School has its fair share of students interested in the art of guitar-playing. The school offers guitars (classical and steel-string) publicly available for students to practice or play during their free periods. Practice alone can be harsh. But, Stuy Guitar Club offers the opportunity for anyone interested to learn about guitar. Anyone interested in playing guitar can benefit by attending our meetings. Our club desires to enhance students’ understanding of the divine instrument, introducing new techniques and concepts that will help and improve their playing. We are a network of socialization. Our club provides more than a learning environment. We want music to be social, students to form bonds and lasting relations throughout their high school career and possibly the future. Our club wants to serve as an alternative to the stressful times at Stuy. We want to facilitate the pursuit of the guitar as a passion. Expressive creativity. As the core, we offer all students the opportunity to learn about the process of guitar arrangements and compositions. And as such, we allow every student to pursue their style of musical expression through the guitar. And a little something from our club faculty, Mr.Stephan: Music is good for your brain. ",https://www.facebook.com/groups/502564941505618,"Role applications will always stay open. There are four departments within Stuy Fingerstyle: Composition, Marketing, Education, and Technology departments. Directors lead their corresponding departments. Members will all enter the club as associates under the education department. The only exceptions are those who completed training or reached beginner level. Beginners may apply for roles as managers: instructors, arrangers, and composers in the education and composition departments. Exceptions to musical training are applications to coordination and technology departments where associates may work under coordinators or technicians as in-trainings (in-training manager). Positions in any department correspond with members’ ability to fulfill their duties. Members may join multiple departments. Failure to fulfill their responsibilities may result in role impeachment. Impeachment of any role is determined based on a 3/4 majority vote within management. Any member may report and file for an impeachment. Role impeachment is considered solely on radical reasoning. We intend to provide a network and a learning environment. Any actions against our purpose may result in expulsion. ","Stuy Guitar is unique in its focus on arranging and composing guitar instrumentals. In this case, Stuy Guitar focuses on fingerstyle guitar. Fingerstyle is not just a technique or style. It’s more than plucking or picking strings with fingers. It’s a concept. It’s the study of acoustics on the guitar and applications of every aspect of the instrument. Stuy Guitar offers a unique opportunity for students to develop a firm foundation in guitar playing and a deeper understanding of music theory.","A week ahead schedule of weekly meetings (varied).

We will often work with electronics such as computers (like PCs and game consoles), and computer peripherals such as mice, keyboards, game controllers, and monitors.

Many of the electronics we obtain are donated. We are contacted by the donors via e-mail and set up a meeting with them in a public place. Members are expected to participate in these pickups whenever they can. At least two members will participate in every pickup (so that no one is alone when handling a pickup). 

We also contact schools, libraries, and businesses to arrange pickups of unused/unwanted equipment. 

We plan on visiting e-waste recycling drop-offs to salvage any usable, dropped-off equipment.

Anything we work on will be thoroughly cleaned before and after work is done. 

All computers we work on will have a custom image of Ubuntu created by World Computer Exchange installed after all work is complete.

No previous experience is required, and we're always ready to learn new things and share knowledge. 

StuyFixit is a collaborative environment and we're excited to have you join us :-)""","""Many Stuyvesant students are interested in repairing, modding, and building electronics. Participating in this activity will give these students an outlet to pursue their interests, as well as gain knowledge and experience. We will all learn and improve together :-)

Those who are interested in building computers may be very interested in this activity because they will get hands-on experience with assembling, disassembling, repairing, and refurbishing computers. This can be the perfect low-pressure environment where one can hone their skills before tackling a larger (and more expensive!) project to ensure success. 

We will be a convenient place for Stuyvesant students to safely dispose of unwanted electronics. We're also working with the school to take any unused equipment such as monitors, keyboards, and computers off their hands so that Stuyvesant can be less cluttered and we can have more projects to work on :)

We will add to the honour of Stuyvesant by being the only high schooler run branch of World Computer Exchange.

Our repair oriented club can help make the Stuyvesant community conscious about electronics reapir and show it that absolutely anyone can repair electronics. We'll show not only that it can be done but that it is our RIGHT to repair! Thank you""",,"""Leadership positions include:

2 Co-Presidents 
1 Line Manager
1 Opportunity Commissioner 

The Opportunity Commissioner will search for opportunities where we can acquire electronics to work on and will assign members for pickup duty to acquire them.

The two Co-Presidents will be seniors who participated in this activity the year before. They will manage communication with World Computer Exchange, go on pickups, and handle any paperwork involved (World Computer Exchange procedure requires that we create triage sheets on everything to work on so that it's clear to them what issues a device has before we send it to them). 

The Line Manager divide members into different groups working on different activities during meetings so that we work efficiently. For example, they may assign two people to clean something while they assign another three people to completely disassemble another thing, assign one person to try and find the electrical fault on a faulty PCB, and finally assign a person to look on Google to find a solution for a particular problem we're facing. They will also record the time everyone has spent in service of the club. 

Leadership positions are currently filled on a first come, first serve basis, but this may change over time and as members graduate high school. 

Members must follow rules set inside the building, especially those regarding social conduct (i.e. no swearing or harassment). Members must be respectful to one another when they are speaking. Remember that this club is intended to be a supportive environment so any type of bullying or belligerent behaviour will not be tolerated. We get that sometimes things can be difficult, but we will expect members to talk things through and not escalate conflicts. If members of the club are not satisfied with a leader’s performance, they can either choose to impeach that leader by either voting to remove them from the club or vote to demote that leader to a regular member. Votes will require a two-thirds majority “yea” vote to pass.

Before graduation, a vote will be held among the whole club for each empty seat to choose who the next leaders will be. The member with the most votes will be chosen to replace the graduating leader. It will be a secret ballot. Leaders will stress that voters should vote for whoever they feel has shown leadership qualities and a genuine interest in building the club, regardless of their grade level.""","""We're a community of people resurrecting unwanted electronics for fun and are creating a positive impact while we're at it. With our partnership with World Computer Exchange, we have the resources to actually distribute our repaired and refurbished projects to those who need them. 

Currently, there are no activities in Stuyvesant that fill this niche. 

Sometimes, we will fix electronics through the use of soldering irons. Soldering is an important part of working with electronics and our members will be able to use this skill in many places. There aren’t many places at Stuyvesant where one can learn this valuable skill. 

Together we can combat wastefulness by keeping electronics out of landfills and giving them to those in need. Electronic devices play such a huge part in our daily lives that it makes sense to know how to fix them so we don't have to rely on Big Tech to do it for us. By teaching the student populace about repairing electronics, we can promote a DIY ethic and collectively counter the waste that comes with excessive consumerism, which is something ubiquitous in our society!

This club allows its members the unique opportunity to attain knowledge about computer hardware and to benefit those in need by donating computers that we can fix. There aren’t many clubs like this at Stuy. We have a collaborative environment that encourages helping fellow students and sharing knowledge rather than one that is competitive, a respite from the sometimes stressful environment of Stuyvesant.""",Our meeting schedule will definitely be at least once a month but we aim for at least 3 times a month.,"['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday']",low,"['stuyfixit', 'computers', 'fixing']",,"Chao Lian Lin - President

All sorts of players can join, whether it’s competitive players who desire to improve and discuss current game strategies or casual players wanting to socialize and play with others. Club members will be required to join the discord, which will be the platform used to host events and communicate with other members. The club offers various activities such as coaching by the high-ranked players of the club for those striving to become better or playing matches against other members to build a stronger fellowship amongst the community. We hold discussions involving various topics such as talking about a funny match a member had or analyzing pro play during the competitive season of League of Legends. Although mainly focusing on the game League of Legends, we wish to bring everyone who shares this common interest into a community where they can share their ideas and hang out with each other. With this goal in mind, the club frequently talks about subjects other than League as well, such as school or other games to further strengthen the bonds of our members.","Our club strives to forge tight bonds between those who want to participate in a community that all share a common commitment in the game League of Legends. Our club is a great way to meet new people and possibly form long-lasting friendships. In the demanding environment that entails in Stuyvesant, this will be a place where students can come to relieve themselves of all the stress accumulated and build rapport between students who enjoy playing the game on either a competitive or casual level. By building a community of people with an interest in the same game, we wish to extend comradery outside of just the game, creating an environment where club members are able to support each other in other aspects as well. The club aims to introduce more people to the game, and playing a game such as League of Legends that requires a high intensity of focus in one's mental state is a great experience for players to learn communication skills, critical thinking skills, as well as a sense of accomplishment. The club also offers a plethora of mentors and coaches for students wanting to improve their personal skills and ranks. Another thing the Stuyvesant League Club does is host events on a regular basis that can help boost school spirit, as well as providing members with a sense of comradeship. Overall, the Stuyvesant League Club will bring new people together and allow them to achieve their own goals whether it’s to establish connections with other people or improving themselves to the best of their possibilities.",https://discord.gg/5C3rxMyDHV,"To obtain a leadership position in the Stuyvesant League Club, one has to show high commitment to the club and demonstrate that they are willing to help other members whenever they run into issues. They would have to show a solid understanding of how the procedures of the club work and act in a manner to gain the other club members' respect. Club members who possess all of these qualities would be potential candidates to be conducted into a leadership position. At the end of every year, current club executives will take a look at the club’s needs for the approximate future, interview possible candidates, and hold votes to reach a consensus on the decision for leadership positions. Club leaders will be held to a high standard and expected to fulfill their roles to the best of their ability. If a member feels like a club leader is not performing up to the expectations set by the club, they can bring the issue up to the other leaders anonymously. Afterward, the club leader in question will be thoroughly investigated, and a vote will be conducted between the other leaders on whether to impeach them.	","The Stuyvesant League Club stems from inclusivity. Our attentive community and leaders contain highly skilled players who are readily available to coach other members and help them strive towards improving their abilities. From time to time, stimulating giveaways and tournaments are hosted, allowing winners to obtain small prizes and the entertainment of prude boasting. Even though we're a gaming club, we want to provide the best experience for those who enjoy discussing or playing the game, as well as having a community that can support each other outside the game built due to our common passion for League of Legends. The expanding interest in League of Legends is always great to see, so even if you are inexperienced in the game, our club welcomes you with open arms.","Our club will meet once a week. Club meetings will be very informal and held on every other Wednesday, from 3:35-5 PM. The club is low-commitment and won’t require members to attend every meeting.

Stuyvesant Financial Literacy Club,stuyvesantfinance,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyvesantfinance/3aea271d,To teach students financial literacy and institute a wealth mindset to set them up for future financial success.,"How does Jeff Bezos pay $0 in taxes? Less than my parents? Why do ⅓ lottery winners go broke? How do 60% of all athletes, many of whom are multi-millionaires, lose all their money within 5 years! How did a man go from living in the projects to becoming the CEO of Starbucks? Hint: It all has to do with their mindset.

Our purpose is to teach as many students as possible the millionaire mindset and how to change the way they look at time and money forever, along with crucial financial skills not taught in schools, such as how you can actually use credit cards to your advantage and how to leverage debt to MAKE you money like the 1%. The club also strives to teach life long skills such as taxes and how to read financial books more efficiently.

Although this may sound too good to be true, money doesn’t just grow on trees. Members are strongly encouraged to attend every meeting in order to gain as much knowledge as possible and take notes, and if members are not able to make the meeting, they should contact one of the club leaders ASAP to catch up on any knowledge gaps. Members should also strive to apply everything learned in the club - Knowledge without action is useless, and action without knowledge is futile.

By the end of the year, your perspective on money will have completely changed. You will walk in having the mindset of a consumer, but walk out thinking like a CEO of the next Amazon. 
","In the past 2 years, we’ve gone through a pandemic that has sent shockwaves through the American economy. New York City was one of the areas that was hit the hardest. As a result, 23% of all citizens lost their jobs and suffered financially. This has shed a spotlight on the importance of financial literacy among students, a topic that is seldom discussed in school and has the potential to change the lives of many. 

Throughout the school year, the club will be teaching students many skills, including how to perceive failure as a stepping stone to success, the D.I.G method that has been behind the success of millionaires, how to stop procrastinating and motivate yourself to work when you don't want to, how to leverage social media as a business platform without sounding like a spammer, how to start building your credit score right now as a teen, the importance of time and why 99% of people look at it the wrong way, how to rewire your money blueprint, how to influence others, the secrets of the most successful salesmen and what sets them apart from others, why 97% of youtube channels fail and how you can use the process of “Youtube Automation” to start a successful channel without ever showing your face, how to retire comfortably with a sound financial blueprint, the 10 steps to make money while you sleep, how to turn your interests into income without going broke, and much, much more!

",https://discord.gg/43zSVdXSaE,"There will be a President, a Vice President, a Director of Outreach, and a Director of Curriculum. To select members for the leadership positions mentioned above, we will send out a Google Forms with questions that include “What makes you a good candidate for the role you are applying for?”, “Do you have any previous experience with the role you are applying for?”, and other questions regarding the position of interest After reviewing responses to the Google Forms, we will schedule interviews with the applicants. We will implement a strike system where three strikes leads to impeachment from a leadership position. Actions that can lead to a strike include missing a club meeting without notice and failing to complete positional duties/requirements on time. Applications for the following year will be reviewed and voted on by the board from the previous year. Members are expected to attend all meetings, or provide notice if planning on missing a meeting. Leaders can be impeached if 50% or more of regular members decide that they are not upholding their duties to the best of their ability.","At the Stuyvesant Financial Literacy Club, we teach many valuable, real-life, finance skills and the wealth mindset that aren’t taught in any other club or at Stuy. From getting a credit card and building a credit score as a teenager, to explaining taxes and the importance of wealth mindset, we break down many topics needed to be successful financially. Money comes and goes, but the ability/knowledge to make money stays with you forever.

During our Freshman year, we always wanted to treat ourselves with Pizza every Friday after school. But little did we know that it was going to cost us $2.99 a slice, so we could only afford to eat at home. So over the last year, we dedicated ourselves to learning about money every weekend - in doing so, we learned a lot about the mindset and skills that teenagers can apply to their own lives, not just adults who already have a job making them tens of thousands a year. As a result, the Stuyvesant financial literacy club will be able to teach students and utilize our past mistakes as a tool to help others succeed.

As such, by joining StuyPod, students will have the opportunity to make new friends or connect with old ones. There aren't any expectations for what members need to fulfill so there is no pressure to join the club or even when participating in club meetings. However, we do hope that club members will feel comfortable enough to open themselves up and share their thoughts with the club in order for both the members and the club to grow as a whole. ",,"There are currently three leadership positions: president, vice-president, logistics manager. After careful consideration from existing leaders, new positions can be created if needed. Between the school years, leaders can choose to pass down their position to the most suitable candidate or allow an election in which members vote. Members can impeach a leader if they believe the leader lacks commitment and fails to fulfill their responsibilities. A vote will take place in which if 70 percent of the members vote for the leader to be impeached, a new leader takes over the position after another election. Members are expected to keep behavior school-appropriate with no slurs and cursing. If any form of bullying or harassment is discovered, the member will be kicked out of the club so please be kind and considerate of the stories that other members are sharing. Members will also be expected to comply with safety guidelines as mandated appointed by the DOE. 
","StuyPod is unique as it’s one of the few clubs in Stuy working towards allowing students to start their own podcasts and share their feelings. StuyPod protects students’ privacy while providing various platforms for communication. We hope to be able to work towards opening a radio platform that allows more students to share their opinions and ideas with the entire stuy community. However, starting up we will start our own podcast with the goal of sharing our personal stories in order to create a bonding community environment for club members.

","StuyQuantum focuses on creating a strong community where students can learn about quantum computing and its different applications. This club will expose students to a realm of science they may not have learned about before and will allow them to connect the knowledge they learn about quantum computing with real life scenarios. Quantum computing can often be seen as a daunting field of science and this club aims to get rid of any fear associated with it. We hope to either inspire students to pursue quantum computing or just provide them with knowledge that they can take into their future careers. We wish to provide students with resources and connections that will benefit them in whatever career path they take. We will teach our members important concepts in quantum computing and different tools, such as qiskit(IBM), azure(Microsoft), etc. We hope to have talks with experienced people in this field, visit tech companies in this field, attend hackathons, and work on long term projects as a group.","Quantum computing has become an increasingly popular and important subject. It is considered to be the future because it allows us to solve large and complex problems that would not be able to be solved on a classical computer. As such, it is important for students to be able to learn about this interesting, new field of science. This club will help teach students about different and important concepts related to quantum computing. It will provide a community in which students can learn and grow with others who have the same interests as them. This club is open to students of all backgrounds and levels. We want to provide all students with the resources and community through which to explore quantum computing and make an impact in the field. We encourage everyone and anyone to join. Not only will students be able to gain conceptual knowledge in this field, but they will also be able to learn from experienced professionals and make connections with them. We will provide students with many opportunities to practice their skills, including possible hackathons, visits to companies, long-term club projects, resources and tools with which they can explore on their own, such as IBM qiskit, Microsoft azure, Google cirq, etc. ",https://linktr.ee/stuyquantum,"This club will have a leadership board, led by the Founder/President. Board members will work together to split up the work required to keep the club running. Board members will be appointed through an application process, where their skill and commitment will be accessed. No prior knowledge of quantum computing is required to be a part of the board. Members are expected to complete their share of the work. Member responsibilities will be distributed among the board and will be decided as a whole. Although the work is flexible and this club is meant to be fun, board members are required to fulfill their responsibilities. A failure to do so could result in being removed from the board (if the rest of the board agrees on the decision). Before any of the board members graduate, the board will come together to help choose someone to take their place for the next year (decided through an application process by form).
","What makes this organization unique is that it provides students with numerous resources and a strong community with which they can learn about quantum computing. Quantum computing is not taught in STEM classes in school. Our club hopes to educate students in this field, especially as it becomes increasingly relevant and important. We want to provide students with knowledge in this field as they don’t seem to be getting it anywhere else. Although students can get this information online, our club aims to teach students about quantum computing in a fun and structured way, and provide a close community they can be a part of.

All students are invited to join us - it is never too late to learn a fun new skill! No experience is required prior to joining the club or team, and you will be able to learn everything at meetings. The club members are friendly and happy to help you get accustomed to rowing. Students are able to get a coxswain certification from the boathouse. The club also assists with community rows with the boathouse, teaching newcomers from the public how to row. The club also has a rowing team that competes in three to five races per year around the Northeast. Crews train weekly year-round to maintain skill and muscle mass. Tryouts are usually held in September when school starts. Competitions are often in the winter and spring. The boatbuilders maintain our Whitehall boats, based on a historical design, and repair them when needed. They also build two to three boats per year, ranging in size from Whitehall gigs to canoes. All are welcome - no experience is necessary prior to join and the workshop heads teach members everything they need to know.","The Rowing Club allows students to experience the Hudson River in a special way: by rowing in it! The club accommodates all students who want to row - teaching them, helping to crew the boats, and providing a comfortable and friendly environment. Being able to row literally right past Stuyvesant is a great experience for any student to have: whether it’s once, on a special day, or twice a week at our rows. Many of the teams and athletic clubs at Stuyvesant require students to have prior knowledge and experience of the sport or the game before joining the team. The Stuyvesant Rowing Club is not like that, all members will be taught everything they need to know in order to have a safe and fun time on the water. Only the team admits members based on skill -- the club, which meets twice a week, will teach everyone who comes how to row. The club also participates in various special rows such as rowing around Manhattan, rowing to the Statue of Liberty, and even rowing to New Jersey where rowers can dock on shore and go visit a local restaurant.

They will be selected based on commitment to the club, desire to train new members, and ability to work with current leaders.

The primary purpose of captains is that they will collectively decide on club decisions, train new members, as well as promote the club. The club president is chosen by the captains before the year ends. If a leader is not fulfilling their role in the club, the other captains/president will address specific changes they need to make. If they are unwilling to make those changes they will be asked to step down from leadership.

The co-leaders will help members to learn proper lifting form as well as educate them in proper powerlifting programming and everything that goes into becoming stronger. High School is a great place to start lifting and building muscle in your teenage years, as well as building up habits that will keep you healthy both physically and mentally, and powerlifting is a great area of lifting. Focused around 3 major lifts, the bench press, deadlift, and squat, mastery of these lifts is a sport in and of itself and requires a lot of technique and time. We expect our newer members to come to every meeting in order to learn the form for these lifts and to learn how to structure a powerlifting program leading up to a powerlifting meet. After explaining the nuances to form we expect every member to follow a powerlifting program and either go to a gym they are comfortable with and keep themselves responsible for growing their own strength, or train as a team. Powerlifting is a niche but vibrant community you might find in any gym that is filled with people who will lift you up and help you become stronger no matter your starting point. This club wants to help educate people in the methods to become stronger, how to perform the main powerlifting lifts, and inevitably prepare its members for competitions. 
""","""Stuy Powerlifting will help our community by creating a supportive environment for powerlifting as well as general weightlifting. In other words, this club will be a safe-space for students of all experiences to collaborate on their powerlifting journey. Perhaps the most significant motivation for the creation of this club is to offer novice-level weightlifters and those without experience an opportunity to explore the intricate matter of weight-training through powerlifting. On a related note, I’ve unfortunately seen inexperienced lifters lose sight of their goals, lift weights in a dangerous manner, and live a poor lifestyle outside of the weightroom all too often. However, with the Powerlifting Club, inexperienced lifters can be guided by a plethora of their competent club members to correct these mistakes. 

Another way Stuy Powerlifting will help our community is by allowing student-athletes to improve their physical health in an enjoyable fashion. The sport of Powerlifting develops and improves strength all throughout the body. However, these are not the only benefits; powerlifting also improves skeletal health, posture, body composition, etc. These benefits can help student-athletes become better overall competitors in a multitude of sports, whether it may be football, swimming, or stunt.

Stuy Powerlifting will be very attractive to a variety of students, as the benefits of powerlifting are much to be desired. This diversity will allow club members to connect with students from varied backgrounds, giving members the chance to meet others with intriguing points of view.
In addition, lifting weights with others can foster meaningful relationships. At this club, many members will be working to achieve a common goal: to get better at powerlifting. The act of collaborating to achieve a common goal is a catalyst for forming relationships.
""",,"""Leadership Positions:
Co-leaders: founders of the club
Socials Manager: to be decided

Protocols for Members to Follow:
Members are expected to keep track of their progress in one way or another with the goal of getting stronger over time. They must also follow proper gym etiquette and be respectful no matter how experienced other members are. Members are expected to live a lifestyle conducive to gaining strength outside of our meetings. Lastly, members are expected to attend every session, as consistency is a key factor in improving.

Transfer of Leadership:
The person who shows the most commitment to the club and sport of powerlifting. His or her leadership skills and commitment to learning about powerlifting with a willingness to teach it will be considered as well. Each year, one junior co-leader will continue to be a co-leader in his or her senior year and one new co-leader will be appointed as a junior in the successive year.

Impeachment Procedures: 
If a member or leader is deemed unworthy of his or her position for any reason, his or her actions will be analyzed. Actions such as the abuse of power, the harassment of other members, and bullying will not be tolerated. If any of these actions are identified, the leaders and other members of the club will first make a judgment based on the evidence at hand. Finally, our supervising adult will look over his or her actions and make an executive decision on whether that member should or should not continue to have membership in Stuy Powerlifting.""","""At Stuyvesant, there aren’t any clubs dedicated to any sport that lies under the umbrella of weightlifting. No team or club prioritizes form and weight in their activities in the weightroom, and try to maximize this number. Stuy Powerlifting would be the first club that is an amalgamation of the people who value powerlifting and weight training above all else. This group is vast and advocates for health in diet and exercise yet has no outlet other than joining a specific sports team to use the weightroom.

As one of the biggest clubs at Stuyvesant, SRC seeks to connect people with their community and help them give back in the most convenient way. Members aren't required to volunteer. Rather, they can sign up for the event of their choice on any day in any location throughout the city. Within Stuyvesant, volunteers have been tour guides at Open Houses, assisted teachers during Parent-Teacher-Conferences, and helped run the Alumni Association's reunion events. SRC also hosts the popular and informational annual Health Fair and holds fun bonding events for members, such as Friendsmas. However, SRC also wants volunteers to expand their influences and networks beyond the walls of Stuyvesant. Thus, volunteers have refereed for wheelchair basketball tournaments, raised money for international, national and local disasters, and participated in walks and races. Due to complications caused by COVID-19, the SRC board has created virtual volunteering opportunities over Zoom and many ongoing events such as donations and wellness challenges. Finally, the club aims to provide numerous opportunities for its members to bond through volunteering and make new friends while contributing to the community.","Stuyvesant Red Cross (SRC) benefits the Stuyvesant community by offering its services to different facets spread throughout New York City, whether it be in museums, at parks for clean-ups and races, or at children's centers. In doing so, not only are volunteers helping the external community, exposing themselves to the different areas of the city, and spreading the SRC mission, but students are also offered the chance to give back and feel a sense of community among other New Yorkers -- Stuyvesant and non-Stuyvesant students alike. At events, many Stuyvesant students are in situations where they must engage in teamwork, allowing for new friendships to be forged. This allows the Stuyvesant body to grow even more tight-knit as a community. The club also teaches its members that volunteering is a wonderful act of kindness that can be returned through the simplest of ways, often through a smile or a verbal expression of gratitude. Members can also contribute directly to the Stuyvesant community, as Red Cross provides opportunities to volunteer as tour guides at school Open Houses, assist teachers at Parent-Teacher Conferences, manage Alumni Association events, and volunteer at the multiple blood drives held in school. SRC receives no physical token in return, allowing volunteers to help purely for the sake of community service. In this sense, SRC is looking to help Stuyvesant students extract their inner kindness and apply it to humanitarian causes and the real world.",instagram.com/stuyrc,"Leaders are appointed through review of their applications to the board, which are done through a written application followed by a formal interview with the board. Once a member is accepted as a leader, they will remain as a trial leader until the end of the trial period. During the trial period, they are expected to learn the duties of a board leader, which include sending events emails, contacting coordinators, organizing in-school events, and other tasks that involve managing the club as a whole. If trial leaders fail to complete these duties or fail to maintain a good academic standing (85+ overall average), they will be given a strike. If trial leaders receive three strikes, they may be impeached from the board. After the trial period, leaders are officially part of the board. All board leaders (including trial leaders) may apply for a position on the executive board, which consists of three Vice Presidents and two co-presidents. The previous executive board reviews their applications and conducts interviews in order to determine the next executive board. Both leaders and volunteers are expected to uphold the mission of the American Red Cross as members of Stuyvesant Red Cross. ","Stuyvesant Red Cross (SRC) is open to anyone who wants to positively influence their community. Students can join at any time of the year and they can dedicate as much time as they would like to the club. SRC is affiliated with the American Red Cross (ARC), meaning volunteers receive special access to ARC events and the ability to be a part of a larger network in Greater NYC (i.e. the annual International Humanitarian Law Campaign, the Pillowcase Project, CPR lessons, events at the GNY Headquarters, and more!). SRC focuses on contributing to larger relief efforts and spreading awareness on current humanitarian events/disasters throughout the world, which volunteers can get involved with through these special ARC projects. At the end of every year, SRC hosts an Awards Ceremony to commemorate volunteers who have reached over 20 hours, which special certificates and prizes for those that reach over 40 or over 60 hours. In addition to receiving certificates, SRC also rewards volunteers with a fun party filled with pizza, snacks, and music after the awards distribution.

The club provides students with a deeper and more exciting look at history through participation in events such as History Bowl competitions, where members compete as a team against schools from around the country in history trivia. There are city competitions throughout the year that the history club competes in, and at the end of the year, there is a national competition. During the weekly meetings, members will have the chance to participate in a wide range of history-related activities, such as practicing for History Bowl competitions and working on projects for events such as National History Day. In addition to practicing for History Bowl, the club is a space where students can discuss current events or historical subjects of interest, or ask questions regarding topics and assignments in their social studies classes. No prior knowledge is required, just an interest to learn more. The club meets once a week and members are expected to regularly attend meetings as well as History Bowl competitions which occur around three times a year on weekends. Members are also encouraged to participate in individual competitions such as the History Bee or Geography Bee which the club will hold practices for if there is enough interest.

In the last fours years, members of the History Club were able to regularly reach the quarterfinals and semifinals of regional tournaments and even earned awards at the 2022 national competition in Washington DC. Moreover, the History Club is faculty advised by Dr. Greenwald who has taken a lot of time to develop the club's agenda so that it can best benefit students who are interested in learning more about history and further exploring their interest in the subject. Finally, students who require extra help in history or want to be better prepared for their history classes can come to meetings to seek help from upperclassmen who already did well in those courses.

These positions will be chosen at the start of the year through collective agreement. In the future, there may be additional leadership positions added such as members in charge of managing and requesting funds and other positions that are deemed necessary. Leadership positions for each year are currently decided by collective agreement at the end of the previous year and approved by Dr. Greenwald who is the faculty advisor of the club. Some factors that impact the choosing of leaders are seniority within the club, previous leadership within the club and commitment. When transferring leadership between school years, the new leaders will be taught everything they need to know to facilitate a successful and smooth transition.

Throughout the year we will be going over the basics of video game design, programming, and development. This will be done through lessons and collaborative mini-projects later on. After going through the learning process we hope to be able to produce a finished game that everyone will have the opportunity to collaborate on. Beyond the lessons, the club will also act as a forum where members can share and discuss any game development projects they may be working on as well as search for partners to work on projects outside of the club.

","The purpose of Stuy Orgo Chem is to introduce Stuyvesant High School students about the wonderful wonders of organic chemistry and nurture an knowledgeable learning environment for a little acknowledged field. As part of the Stuy Orgo Club, students will join a larger STEM community where other intellectual peers gather and collaborate to further their understanding of organic chemistry. Our club aims to make an advanced STEM topic available to all students at Stuyvesant in an approachable manner. Members of the club will explore the many careers in organic chemistry, including its uses in life-saving drugs and other industry uses. Moreover, we will delve into various, essential molecules, compounds, and reactions associated with organic chemistry. Students will also gain insight on recent organic chemistry research and breakthroughs. Last but not least, in our club, students will find a place to seek friendly guidance in their current and future studies in the field of chemistry. 
","Unlike other STEM and chemistry-related clubs at Stuyvesant, Stuy Orgo Chem Club aims to fill in a niche want for more organic chemistry oriented education for future students who pursue this field. Students from all backgrounds in chemistry are encouraged to join this club and learn more about this specific field of chemistry. One of our primary goals in this club is to host in person and virtual labs where students can manipulate solutions and chemical compounds to understand the beauty of organic chemistry. These will be fun hands-on experiments where students are guided by club leaders and faculty advisors. Additionally, various speakers from universities and other distinguished individuals will be invited to speak about their experiences in this invaluable field of chemistry. Students will have the opportunity to ask speakers questions about careers in organic chemistry as well as advice in this area. Furthermore, students that don’t have the chance to take the Organic Chemistry class at Stuyvesant will have the opportunity to learn it here in our club. Underclassmen who are interested in taking Organic Chemistry can introduce themselves to this subject through our club and see if they would still be interested in the course. And students taking the elective can join the club and gain supplementary knowledge on organic chemistry or help on specific topics. In our club, anyone can participate in conversations and lessons in a noncompetitive and non stressful environment. Most importantly, more than just a place to learn, our members will bond and make friends in a close knit community. 
",,"Stuy Orgo Chem has copresidents that act in the best interest of the future of the club. They will be planning all lesson plans as well as teaching the lessons. Members can be promoted to an officer level such as teacher and lab expert by showing interest in the club. The outgoing leaders will be nominating several members based on commitment and a standard interview process. There is also a basic application form that members could fill out to make themselves more known to the leadership. When the candidates are chosen as the incoming copresidents, there will be an election by all members, with the top 3 candidates sharing the roles of co-presidency. In the case of impeachment, the members can oust the leadership if given a 2/3 majority and grievances explained in detail to the school administration. Then another election will be held to vote on the new leadership team within 1 weeks time.
","Currently, organic chemistry is rarely explored except for one elective taught by Dr. O'malley. Our club will fill in this void in organic chemistry courses and clubs at Stuyvesant. Stuy Orgo Club will be the only club that offers students guidance and educational opportunities regarding organic chemistry. Organic chemistry is “real life” chemistry; it is a continuation of the honors and AP chemistry classes Stuy students can take. Another unique part about our club is that we invite guest speakers with a specific focus on organic chemistry. Our interactive imperson and virtual experiments will allow students to experience first hand what organic chemistry is like. Club members are also more than welcome to suggest organic chemistry topics and reactions they would like to focus on. We also hope to expand our club to offer research opportunities and internships for our members.

Representing Stuyvesant High School, we practice often on fields in Upper Brooklyn and travel, often out of state, to tournaments and competitions. No prior experience is necessary because we will teach you the basics such as throwing and movement on the field. Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport, relying on all the members to contribute the game on the field, even if you're not on the point! From handlers moving the disc, to cutters advancing it forward, to the sideline shouting calls and guidance to those on the field, the teamwork involved is critical. As beginners practice and develop more skills, they will be exposed to a more advanced level of play. The people you make bonds with on Ultimate are not just limited to the sport: they will be your friends outside of the field as well! Pick up a disc and join this tight knit community of athletes!

Joining Ultimate is a commitment to work hard! Showing up to most, if not all, practices is a good indication of your commitment. Members are required to purchase a pair of cleats if they are committed to playing Ultimate Frisbee. They are recommended to have a disc on them as well. Practice throwing outside of practice is a very strong recommendation.
","Ultimate Frisbee is a growing force in the world of sports in the United States, with an estimated 7 million players in the phenomenon worldwide. The Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers, as Stuyvesant's Ultimate Frisbee team, provides an outlet to Ultimate within the Stuyvesant and New York community. Ultimate Frisbee is more difficult to come across in New York due to the urban cityscape, making field space less readily available and thus more competitive. We provide students interested in playing competitive Ultimate Frisbee with the opportunity to play at practice, games, and tournaments. By having us, Stuyvesant is put at the forefront of one of the world's thriving sport.
Ultimate Frisbee at Stuyvesant brings many additional benefits to the community. Many Ultimate Frisbee players form close bonds with one another, allowing members to find their niche within the Stuyvesant community. Ultimate Frisbee members often take pride in their association with the sport: many graduating seniors have taken their yearbook photo with a Stuyvesant disc in hand. It also gives kids a reason to go outside and enjoy the outdoors while doing something fun. It may even help with the transition to college, as Ultimate Frisbee is a very popular and frequent way to make new friends by establishing the commonality between two people.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/592226052282393/,"It is standard to have 2 senior captains and 1 junior captain for the Boy's A team. Captains are selected each year through a discussion between coaches and that year's captains. Commitment and leadership qualities are the factors for potential captainship. After the coaches and captains have narrowed down the candidates to one senior and one junior, they are informed about it during the final team meeting and it is there where it is announced.

Impeachment also works through communications through the non-offending captains and the coaches. If a captain is noted to demonstrate poor captainship, it is discussed between the other captains and the coaches. The offending captain will be informed of his behavior through a dialogue. If the offender does not change his behavior, a decision is made by the coaches and the other captains to remove the offending captain from his position and to pick a new, more suitable captain to fulfill the leadership role.","Ultimate Frisbee is a sport unlike any other, both mechanics wise and gameplay wise. 

Ultimate Frisbee combines the skills of various sports into one. In addition, a disc is used rather than a ball, which allows for a different style of gameplay than more traditional sports. The flying and floating nature of a disc create opportunities for players to make amazing plays, such as """"skys"""" and """"layouts"""".

Ultimate players follow what is known as the Spirit of the Game. In Ultimate Frisbee, players call their own violations and have civilized discussion as to their reasoning. Often, if a player was in the wrong and is aware of it, he or she will display true sportsmanship and admit the error/violation.

The Cabinet consists of four positions: President, Vice President, and two Secretaries. Cabinet members are selected at club elections, which are typically held in late May or early June. The elections are moderated by the current Cabinet. Candidates present speeches and members vote on who they feel would best represent and lead the club in the coming school year. In order to run for Secretary or Vice President, candidates must accumulate at least 25 service hours. In order to run for President, candidates must accumulate at least 30 service hours.

The Advisory Council consists of committee directors and event leaders and works on specific club projects. Specific positions may vary from year to year based on club plans. The positions for the 2021-2022 school year are as follows: Green Team Committee Directors, Communications Committee Director, Social Media Committee Directors, Research Committee Directors, and Gardening Committee Directors. Advisory Council members are chosen by the newly elected Cabinet through an application form.

Should an elected or appointed officer neglect their responsibilities or fail to sufficiently meet expectations, this member will first be held accountable through a discussion with the other members of the Leadership Council, and a warning will be issued. However, if a pattern of improper behavior continues, they will hold a public discussion on the conduct of that officer during a monthly meeting as they highly value the opinions of members in decisions. Should members decide another candidate would better represent themselves and the club, a new election will be held regardless of the position.","The Stuyvesant Environmental Club is unique because of its specific focus and wide range of activities: we're a tight-knit community of environmental enthusiasts with a variety of hobbies, interests, and talents. Our variety of activities, ranging from more science-focused ones like writing research articles for publications to more arts-focused ones like social media design and upcycled crafts, ensures that there's something for everyone. The Environmental Club offers so many different experiences, providing members with the freedom to explore various aspects of sustainability and environmentalism.

With the different approaches and interests of our club leaders, we hope to explore many facets of this beloved craft.

Does this club sound interesting but you've never managed to knit a row or a stitch? Never fear! We are committed and equipped to get yourself knit into the fabric of our knitting community.

Meetings will be held once or twice a month. We plan to invite guests to learn from professional knitters. We will also hang out, knit, and have the opportunity to get help with our individual projects. Stuy Knits plans to host Knit-A-Longs as a community builder for Stuyvesant. In addition, we may make specific donations to charities seeking our knitting expertise like Knots for Love and Blankets for the Homeless. ","This activity will benefit the stuy community in many ways. 

Stuy knits celebrates knitting and its interesting and unique history. It connects knitters with varied skills and abilities, contributing to a healthy and vibrant crafting and knitting community at Stuyvesant. There are many knitters that attend Stuy, many of whom may not know who else knits or how to further develop their skills. This club provides the resources and the community for these individuals. 

Knitting also incorporates deep mathematical concepts into craft. Having this underrepresented aspect of the craft is especially important at Stuyvesant, where a very strong mathematical interest exists among the student body. Being able to envision and understand math in terms of knitting is a useful and exciting skill. 

Knitting has a deep and rich history of knitting and its evolution has impacted many unexpected areas of our lives. In the club we will explore how knitting evolved as well as the interesting culture that has evolved around it. This is vital for a knitter to know, as it is easy to only scrape the surface of what knitting has to offer and miss a whole world of knowledge and amazement. 

Knitting has also been shown to destress and improve the mental health of people. This is also important at a school where so many people are feeling stressed out. 

The Stuyvesant student body is a group of incredibly creative and interesting individuals. It is important to have clubs that represents this group of students.",,"For administrative matters there will be two co-presidents of the Stuy Knits club. These presidents make sure that the club has access to the resources that the club needs as well as keeping the club running smoothly. When either of the two presidents wish to retire or step back in an advisory capacity, they are free to do so. The club will then vote on a new leader.

We have the support of the Stuyvesant Competitive Gaming Club, who we are working with on the production side of operations. The team has already been playing together for more than a year and could continue to grow with new blood. Overwatch is a popular video game, and students who play for fun might find a place in a community and a goal to strive towards in this club. The Stuyvesant Overwatch team, as an extracurricular activity, gives more meaning to the game than just playing the game at home. Gaming is a great way to make friends, especially now during the pandemic, so a community centered around it could be a great help for students who may have spent little time socializing at Stuy in person. Building teamwork and cooperative skills is an essential part of a high school education, and we believe that we can provide that just as well as any other sport.

The captain's role is to organize the team's schedule and practices and rally the team into a cohesive community. Coaches can provide insight to improve play from the sidelines. The idea is that players who understand the game, but don't want to play in matches themselves, can still contribute to improving the team by coaching newer members.

Players are also encouraged to play a role in leadership and communication. We believe that every part of the team should contribute to building team coordination, and those who do this the most will naturally take on leadership positions when the opportunity comes to them.

Should the community feel as though a student in a leadership role must be impeached, a discussion will be held among all leaders and players on the team. An open forum will allow members to respectfully air their grievances and offer solutions, and come to a conclusion that will set the club in a better direction.

StuyLaw,stuylaw,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuylaw/7915890a,"StuyLaw provides an enriching experience for all to delve into the legal world and builds bridges between students and legal professionals.
","StuyLaw’s purpose is to provide abundant opportunities to explore the legal world. This club was founded to provide links to the next steps after high school in law, government, and politics. StuyLaw fosters connections with courts, law firms, and other legal establishments to allow ambitious, aspiring attorneys to get integrated with people already in the work field. Through mock trials, proceedings, presentations, Q&As, and other opportunities, those who yearned to have a designated club for law will have a chance to finally meet those aspirations. StuyLaw establishes an active, professional environment for all aspiring members through a set club structure, active meetings and legal opportunities to once and for all give law a place in the Stuyvesant community. Despite the restrictive nature of certain upperclassmen-exclusive electives relating to law, this club openly welcomes all Stuyvesant students thus providing underclassmen and upperclassmen alike a head start in the legal world. Active members are expected at the very least to attend meetings twice a month, but there are constant opportunities provided in the legal world.
","The club works to benefit the Stuyvesant community by presenting students with career options outside of the STEM ones focused on by the school. StuyLaw offers the opportunity for all students to explore the field of law at whatever depth they choose. Stuyvesant’s current system limits the opportunity to learn about the legal system, in which it is only given to the fortunate upperclassmen in the law classes. However, StuyLaw changes this for the students – as it provides a welcome outlet for students to pursue their interests in law, or even simply explore legal professions that slightly interest them. StuyLaw also benefits the Stuyvesant community by introducing the students to professionals outside of the teaching field. Stuyvesant students will be given a chance to interact with adults of different careers, learning from them and getting inspiration in varying ways. Beyond interaction with legal professionals, members will also be given the chance to learn about law through their peers. StuyLaw hosts legal presentations which include information about the New York State Court System, the structure of the criminal justice system, and other activities club members are interested in. StuyLaw also hosts legal discussions, so students will be able to gain experience in public speaking and socializing.
",https://linktr.ee/stuylaw,"StuyLaw’s executive board is in charge of appointments. Currently, the executive board consists of two people: the Co-Presidents. They are appointed by the previous executive board. The Co-Presidents are responsible for organizing meetings, reaching out to legal speakers for legal opportunities, managing social media platforms, and communicating with the SU/school. 

During the school year, the Co-Presidents will select a Cabinet, consisting of club members who want to increase their involvement within the club. Their responsibilities are expected to be fulfilled in a timely and effective manner, and are subject to expand. 

Regarding impeachment protocols, an executive/club member must find an executive member guilty of an inappropriate, improper, or negligent action (ex: bullying, harassment, discrimination, long-term inactivity, etc.) and collect 15 signatures from active club members to initiate an impeachment hearing with the Student Union. The executive board and Student Union members must reach a majority to remove the executive and further disciplinary action will be taken if necessary; the remaining executive may choose to replace the executive removed or eliminate the position. 

The Co-President has the ability to remove members of the Cabinet over smaller infractions with legitimate reason including, but not limited to, neglecting work, inactivity in meetings/webinars, or delaying club progress. Three strikes result in the removal of a Cabinet member. Cabinet members have the ability to challenge a strike, and they can do so up to five days after the strike is administered. Strikes are reset each school year. 
","StuyLaw is unique because of the opportunity it provides to meet legal professionals and learn about law. The only law classes at Stuy are electives, all of which are incredibly oversubscribed, and StuyLaw plans to make it easier for the rest of the school to learn about the legal professions in New York and beyond. StuyLaw has opportunities in meetings on a regular basis throughout the school year (twice a month), as well as weekly opportunities to get involved in the legal world through partnerships with the courts, law firms, and other organizations with StuyLaw’s connections. Members are directly involved with StuyLaw functions through deciding meeting dates, weighing in on content of activities, engaging in activities, and giving opinions on what type of guest speakers are hosted.
","StuyLaw hosts general meetings, with activities ranging from legal discussions to legal presentations to other legal activities, two times a month. A StuyLaw executive surveys members on the meeting date the week before a designated meeting, in which the most popular day is chosen. StuyLaw will have one legal guest speaker per month and additionally provide multiple virtual live court days for the members’ discretion. Virtual court schedules will be posted at the beginning of each month when available. These activities and their frequencies are subject to change.

The Stuyvesant TCG Club,stuytcg,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuytcg/5b064056,"Stuyvesant TCG Club is a place where students can learn and play trading card games, relax, and make new friends.","The Stuyvesant TCG club is a club for fans of popular trading card games such as Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, Cardfight Vanguard, the Pokémon TCG, etc.. The club is primarily oriented towards players of Magic: the Gathering, but we are open to players of all TCG’s and similar games and would love for a wider variety of people to join. The club provides cards and decks for members, teaches new players how to play, organizes larger events (such as tournaments and drafts), and, most importantly, provides a place for people who share an interest in these amazing strategic games to come together and have fun. Club members often play larger 3-6 person free-for-all or team formats, as opposed to the traditional one versus one competitive gameplay of these games, to promote the friendly social environment of the club. General members are expected only to come when they want to and have fun when they do!
","The Stuyvesant TCG Club benefits the Stuyvesant community in much the same way as other recreational clubs like the Board Games Club (with whom we share a close relationship) do: by providing a place for students with similar interests to come together and have fun. Stuyvesant is a large and often stressful place, and clubs like ours help our members to make friends, and to (if only briefly) escape the stress of the Stuyvesant daily routine to do something fun while still intellectually stimulating. Stuyvesant TCG Club members always look forward to the fun of a club meeting on Friday — it’s not TGI Friday here, it’s TCG Friday!

Trading card games are known for their high complexity, both in gameplay structure and strategy. Playing these games helps develop players’ problem solving and forward planning skills as they think through their actions each turn to try to maneuver into a winning position. The building of a deck to play the game also stimulates a player’s creative side, as they consider the many different options at their disposal to construct a deck that is uniquely their own. TCG’s are also very social games that bring fellow players together through their love of the game, and our club emphasizes this by playing larger group game formats as opposed to standard one versus one games to develop communication and teamwork skills.
",https://discord.gg/E3bpF6vyRg,"The leadership of the Stuyvesant TCG Club consists of at least one President and at least two Vice Presidents.

The President(s) is/are expected to organize and show up consistently to meetings, and to teach and recruit new members. They are also expected to set up and provide materials for larger events and to have extra decks on hand at meetings to lend to other members.

The Vice Presidents are expected to help organize and show up consistently to meetings, and to teach and recruit new members. They are also expected to help set up larger events and to have extra decks on hand at meetings to lend to other members.

Leadership positions are open to all club members. Leadership is appointed through an election process at the end of each year that is open to all active club members. Existing leadership is required to run for re-election if they want to retain their positions, but roles will default to their current holders in the absence of challengers.

Existing leadership must create a series of interview questions to ask each candidate, and to which they must also state their own personal answers. The interviews must be conducted openly so that all voting club members may know each candidate’s responses. 

Existing leadership may remove a candidate from the election before voting given sufficient reason to do so. Such action requires unanimous agreement by existing leadership, but can be overridden by a ⅔ majority vote by active club members.

In the election, all active club members not currently running for a leadership position may vote. Voters rank their top three candidates for each position. It is up to the new leadership whether to appoint additional officers to a position beyond the required numbers, in which case they are chosen in order of most votes. 

	In the event that a position becomes vacant outside of elections or a position is not filled by elections, the highest-ranking officer below that position will be promoted to take the position, then leadership will appoint someone to fill the vacant role.

	Given reasonable justification, an officer in any position may be impeached by either unanimous agreement by the rest of leadership combined with a >50% majority vote of active club members, or by a ⅔ majority vote of active club members regardless of leadership decisions.
","The Stuyvesant TCG Club is the only club at Stuyvesant for players of trading card games, and often the only way for these people to find each other in such a large school. It is also a uniquely friendly and social environment for the players of these games as compared to the alternative of going to events at game stores. The Stuyvesant TCG Club also has a long-running history, dating back to the time when drafting and robotics teacher Mr. Blay was a Stuyvesant student and founding member. We provide a primary outlet for non-digital (before quarantine), non-athletic entertainment at Stuyvesant — something which should be preserved in a world increasingly disappearing into video games.",Our meeting schedule is varies throughout the year as we always meet on Wednesdays and Fridays but we may sometimes meet on different days in case of holidays or anything similar,"['friday', 'wednesday']",low,"['card', 'social', 'gaming']",We provide loaner decks and teach people so no need to worry about not knowing how to play,"Albert Chen - Co-President

Join if you want to improve your game or just for fun!,"StuyPong is meant for recreational table tennis. We usually set up one to three tables on the first floor near the pool or outside the cafeteria after school. We can teach players many things such as but not limited to how to serve, how to add spin, and how to loop or even what a loop is. You can get pointers from people from both the boys and girls team on how to improve table tennis technique and/or just play around for fun. This is a good chance to see if you want to try out for the winter PSAL table tennis team. The girls and boys team have been the best in the city for many years and we are hoping to win this upcoming season. This club is meant to be very chill and low commitment. We hope to make it a place where everyone from table tennis team members to recreational players can just hang out and share a hobby. ","This activity will benefit Stuyvesant by providing a means and chance for people to play a popular and very fun sport/hobby. Many people have tables in their basements and we give that same experience by just playing around and having a nice time. In addition to that, we can also be very competitive and practice very high level techniques and skill sets that average players wouldn't else have the chance to learn and spectate to. Many of the team members have been playing for many years and have table tennis ratings from tournaments that demonstrate their skill and experience. StuyPong provides these players a chance to play outside of official practice. Many players have never been introduced to table tennis as a sport, but rather as a beginner game for fun. We want to show and introduce players to a totally different, highly skilled sport that they've only probably seen on YouTube. Current team members and experienced players would be able to sharpen up and improve their skills while new and beginner players can learn and be introduced to new techniques. This club will not only demonstrate Stuyvesant's athletic domination, but also its broad scope of clubs. Ultimately, we want Stuyvesant to have a place where people can play, learn, and practice table tennis.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/stuypong/,"Leaders are chosen by the recommendation of the past years’ leaders and by majority approval of all the members. At the end of year, graduating leaders and others will mutually agree on next years' people to take charge of the club. Leaders should have an open schedule to allow for weekly meetings in accordance to all the members' schedules. They should be able to notify members and non-members alike about meeting dates. Without leaders organizing times to play, the club will be very dry and inconsistent which is not what we want. They should also set up and put away the tables properly making sure that's just how they left them. They should make sure no one harms the equipment and all equipment is used properly. Most significant though, is that they should be very friendly and provide a wholesome environment for everyone who comes along to our club. If a present leader does not meet these requirements, or if any other leader or club member has an objection to this leader's actions or general behavior, they will be given a single warning. If again this leader does not cooperate, the other leaders will have a group discussion and come to a agreement on whether or not this leader should be impeached or removed from the club. All in all, a leader should take ownership of equipment and club organization.",Our organization is unique because we are the only organization that allows people to casually play table tennis. We provide people the opportunity to just hang out and chill with their friends while playing ping pong. Our team members don't have to go to expensive official table tennis clubs and new members wouldn't have to go out of their way to simply try out a new sport. No other organization in Stuyvesant can compare to what we have to offer for the sport of table tennis.,"We will have a few meetings at the start of the year, and a few times per week after the table tennis season ends","['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday']",low,"['ping', 'sports', 'casual']",,"Max Yenlee - Creator

Stuyvesant Seekers Christian Fellowship,seekers,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/seekers/85ff0332,"Our mission is to provide a safe space to field questions about Christianity and to learn more about and grow in the Christian faith.
","Stuyvesant Seekers intends to create an open space for students to learn about God and have edifying fellowship. We welcome students of all backgrounds, ranging from Christians desiring a deeper spiritual relationship with Christ to non-Christians who seek to learn more about what we believe in. We aim to foster a greater understanding of who God is and build a strong, diverse family within Stuyvesant. We endeavor to achieve this by studying the Bible together, planning group events, inviting guest speakers and professors, and discussing Christianity. The Bible speaks about living to glorify God by following His teachings about love, joy, kindness, faithfulness, self-control, gentleness, and obedience; through this club, we desire to glorify Him by following these good characteristics. 

Additionally we hope to be able to answer questions others have about Christianity and to provide a space where people can express their doubts or frustrations.

John 3:16 (English Standard Version) ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.""""","Seekers will benefit the Stuyvesant community by providing a time for Christians to have fellowship with people around their age during weekdays, allowing them to incorporate their faith into their school life. Seekers also provides a chance for individuals to discuss with their peers about recent developments in their lives in an encouraging, friendly, and non-judgemental environment. Non-Christians will learn more about what we believe and why we believe in the actual occurrences of events described in the Bible. We want to create an environment that is welcoming, where people can have peaceful conversations about controversial topics related to the Bible. Stuyvesant Seekers also works with the Christian Seekers International fellowship which has branches in New York City. This allows our members to connect with pastors and other religious leaders outside of our club. It gives members insight on Christianity outside of high school and will be a valuable resource in the future. Students will learn about theological teachings regarding Christianity and the study of apologetics in order to further their own understandings behind it. This will garner an environment where students are more aware of Christianity and its teachings, which provides a foundation of faith and hope in Jesus Christ. ",Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2394226918/ Instagram: @stuyseekers,"Leaders should never avoid their responsibilities. Leaders of the club are expected to:
- Be Honest
- Participate in Seekers activities
- Show up to Seekers’ meetings
- Contribute to organizing meetings and plans in equal parts as their co-leaders
- Help plan Seekers events
- Encourage other members of the club
- Train members to prepare for future leadership opportunities

Leaders who fail to adhere to these expectations will be evaluated on the board in order to determine if they deserve to stay a leader. If a leader is impeached, there will be a meeting among club members to determine if another leader needs to be elected.

All members of the club are expected to make others feel welcome and at home. The club will act as a judgment-free zone based on trust where everyone can share their personal experiences and struggles with the rest of the club.

For the appointment of future leaders, we send out a form to members applying for a leadership position. Afterwards, everyone who fills out a form applying to a leadership position will get an interview with the entire board. Then we begin choosing suitable future leaders. The club board looks at member participation in events and the contribution to the club. Members should display a genuine devotion to God and dedication to the club.

The clubs current goal will be to improve solar and wind power as those are the easiest to implement quickly on a small scale, and to try to find a way to create a cleaner battery to support the previously mentioned green energy. These goals will also change as they are completed, moving on to tackle problems in agriculture, architecture and the removal of carbon from the air. After a prototype is designed theoretically we would try and build that prototype and hopefully implement them in the school and even around the city. The club will also be focused of solving logistical problems that may come with the implementation of green energy.

Throughout the rest of the month, there will be casual, conversational meetings that members can attend to discuss our book of the month, but there are no specific requirements or conditions—you’re free to participate as much or as little as you wish!","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community in all the ways that reading has been shown to help individuals, such as increasing empathy, reducing stress, expanding vocabulary, and bettering writing skills. However, YA books are unique in that while they address many challenging social issues, they are also much easier to read than literary classics with the same objective. Although literary fiction can absolutely be enjoyable in its own way, most works in this genre are not written with a teenage audience in mind. The Crow Club helps students expand their worldview by reading about experiences as important as those portrayed in literary fiction, but from a teenage perspective, making these experiences much more relatable and understandable. Additionally, the Crow Club allows students to take a break from school-mandated analysis and discussion points by maintaining a casual atmosphere. This helps students to simply enjoy reading for what it is—a way to relax and escape from reality, as well as a way to forge new connections based on shared interests. It’s important to remember that Stuyvesant students are still teenagers, and we deserve to consume fiction that is written about us and for us without having to classify it as a “guilty pleasure.” ","Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stuy_crow_club/, Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/444943376870307, Notion: https://www.notion.so/here-is-the/the-crow-club-b1e14a4b19904f1cb5907750596d72e8","The Crow Club is headed by two co-presidents and a social media manager who work together to choose each month’s book, facilitate discussions at meetings, and maintain outreach. Leaders may alternate months so that each month’s discussion is presided over by one person, but all leaders are expected to participate actively in club matters at all times. If a leader fails to complete their duties, members and/or their fellow leaders may express their concerns in an anonymous Google Form submission. Every such submission will be counted as a strike against the leader in question; if they receive three strikes, a club meeting will be held. If at least half of the members present vote to impeach, they will be removed from their position. A leader may remain in their position for multiple years if they wish to. If one or several leaders decide to step down, interested members will have the opportunity to submit anonymous applications, which the current leaders will review. The new leader(s) must be approved by at least two of the current leaders. ","The Crow Club is unique because it gives students an opportunity to indulge in teen fiction, a hobby that many may deem frivolous (especially in an academically rigorous environment like Stuyvesant), without having to be ashamed of their interests. Additionally, there is no pressure at all to participate in any kind of deep, analytical thinking as a member of this club. Though discussion inspired by such thinking is certainly welcome, the purpose of the Crow Club is to provide Stuyvesant’s bookworms a place to do what they love most without it becoming a literary analysis assignment. Members are free to join in on as many or as few book discussions as they wish. All of this allows for a casual and relaxed club setting that is free from additional academic stressors.","We hold meetings once or twice a month, depending on what book we're reading.",['friday'],low,"['reading', 'books']",,"Abigail Chung - President

StuyGivesSoup,StuyGivesSoup,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/StuyGivesSoup/704a8069,StuyGivesSoup is a club of soup enthusiasts/volunteers dedicated towards spreading their love of soup to underprivileged members of society. ,"
This club is a fun, low commitment group where members discuss all things related to soup. Whether you're a soup connoisseur or just a casual soup drinker, if you are interested in food, making food, or soup in general, then this club is for you! Activities include soup seminars, soup samplings, soup drives, soup debates, and soup reviews. Volunteer opportunities will be available on various occasions. Members will be able to make soup to donate to homeless shelters and community fridges. Members are expected to attend at least one volunteer opportunity per semester. We also aim to promote cultural exchange through sharing soups and recipes from different cultural backgrounds. In addition, all of our lactose intolerant and IBS friends will be appreciated and included in our club. We hope to create a friendly, relaxed environment for soup-lovers to hang out. You can join during any time of the school year and leave any time you wish. We hope to see you there!","
Soup is an important dish in many different cultures. By sharing our love of soup, we hope to spread different cultural traditions. In addition, soup can be easily consumed and stored for long periods of time, making it accessible to the less privileged. Through volunteer work, it fosters a sense of community and empathy for the less privileged in NYC. It also teaches the younger generation how to make soup and prepare ingredients from scratch. Being able to cook for yourself is a major hurdle in becoming an adult. It can prepare Stuyvesant students for college life, where they may often find themselves in need of a simple and satisfying meal. This promotes their path to becoming responsible, independent, and functioning young adults in the future. This club is a place that allows people to unabashedly be themselves and express their love for soup. Members of the club will work together to make soup, and hopefully, they will be able to bond over this experience and form friendships that will last throughout their time at high school. This club is a very niche community, and it may be difficult to find other people that feel as strongly about soup outside a club. ",,"
StuyGivesSoup is a democratic club where each member has the same say in the club's activities. However, there will be presidents, secretaries, and treasurers to maintain the logistics of the club. Leaders will need to have been in the club for at least one year as they would need to have insights on the club. Leaders will be chosen based on a mixture of participation, interest, dedication, and seniority. The club will hold elections that every member can participate in for the positions of secretary and treasurer. For the position of president, at the end of the year, the current president will propose candidates and the rest of the members will vote for the candidate that they feel is the best fit. If there is discontentment with the leadership of the club, there will be a brief investigation of the issue and a group discussion. If the majority of the group agrees that the leader should be replaced, the club will hold an election.
","While other food-related clubs are available, StuyGivesSoup is unique in that it focuses on a niche interest. It also combines community service with the interests of the members and turns a passion into real world functions. There are no other organizations at Stuy that focus on soup, so therefore StuyGivesSoup is the only place where people who have a special interest towards soup will be able to gather. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on community within the group with our democratic practices, so everyone will feel equal.

Disaster Preparedness,disasterpreparedness,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/disasterpreparedness/78c1b521,"Stuy Disaster Preparedness is a club that aims to create a comprehensive disaster preparedness handbook for staff and students to utilize.
","Stuy Disaster Preparedness aims to foster an inclusive club environment where Stuyvesant students will work to put a disaster preparedness guide together. The guide will build off of preexisting disaster preparedness guidelines that the Stuyvesant’s administration has outlined, but will present this information to students in a more user-friendly and accessible format. It will include a survey on Stuyvesant students and ways to respond during school and at home. This issue is more relevant now than ever as Stuyvesant is right along the Hudson River and could possibly be severely affected by floods or hurricanes in a few years.

As a member of Stuy Disaster Preparedness, there will be a number of expectations. To start, meetings attendance is mandatory, and all members will be expected to be self-motivated and take initiative. Furthermore, the more dedication a student has, the higher a chance they will be selected for a leadership position the following year. 
","The first way it will benefit the Stuyvesant community is by creating an inclusive club environment where Stuyvesant students will meet to put a comprehensive disaster preparedness guide together. The club will not tolerate irresponsible students, as most of the club work involves being dedicated and contributing to the guide. Members will be able to meet other like-minded individuals who care about making a stand against climate change. Furthermore, the club will educate its members about how to prepare for natural disasters and improve their research and writing skills. As the guide involves reaching out to the student body and also the administration, members will also learn how to interact with outside points of contact.

The activity will benefit the rest of the Stuyvesant community, even those not currently in the club. The club’s long-term goal is to distribute the guide to many Stuyvesant students and staff members to better inform them about natural disasters. The guide will be helpful in case of an emergency and could be a valuable resource for Stuyvesant to use in future years. If successful, the guide could be amplified for the Battery Park City community as a whole, and the key features of the guide could be incorporated into a website.
",,"Stuy Disaster Preparedness aims to have numerous leadership positions that are not only the President and Vice President positions. For example, Stuy Disaster Preparedness will have a Social Media Marketing Director, who will be responsible for posting on our social media about helpful tips for embracing natural disasters.
For the President and Vice President positions, there will be an application and interview process held at the end of each school year for all interested candidates to apply for. Our goal with this is to make Stuy Disaster Preparedness a fair club that gets passed from year to year.

There will be impeachment procedures implemented for the President and Vice President. If a majority of the members of the club (more than 50% of all club members) believe that the President and Vice President should be impeached and have a petition with enough signatures, the President and Vice President will be removed from office, and there will be a new election held shortly afterwards.
","Our organization is unique in that there is no other current Stuyvesant club that focuses solely on natural disasters, climate change, and weather related events. The club is also unique in that not only will the guide be made by Stuyvesant members, but also it will be used by the broader Stuyvesant community. Stuy Disaster Preparedness will have a very large impact, as our hope is that many Stuyvesant students and staff use our guide.","Our club meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we plan to meet at least once a month.

","The Volleyball Club aims to provide a friendly environment where students can learn about all the different aspects of volleyball. Members will learn both the fundamentals of playing volleyball and the rules of the game. No experience is required! Experienced club leaders will teach members everything they need to know. Meetings will consist of lessons, watching volleyball games, and playing volleyball. We aim to give members a comprehensive and complete understanding of the game through discussions, demonstrations and observation. We will cover all aspects of the sport, including passing, setting, hitting, and serving. The club will have a blend of both indoor and outdoor meetings. When the weather permits, the club will meet outside and practice playing volleyball through drills and practice games. Members are expected to participate actively during meetings and ask any questions they may have. Meetings will be conducted up to once a week on Mondays or Thursdays, and members are expected to attend at least once a month.","Currently, the only opportunity for students to pursue interest in volleyball at Stuyvesant is through the teams; however, there are many students who do not have the time or experience to commit to the team. Volleyball can be a very casual and enjoyable sport to play, and we hope to give students this same experience. Members can create goals for themselves and club leaders will help them reach these goals. The club offers a less stressful and more fun environment for those who want to play outside of the PSAL team. Volleyball team members can also practice during their off season. Club leaders are experienced in the sport, either having played on a Stuyvesant team and/or other programs outside of school. The club also is a place for students to hang out and relax after a long day of school. During meetings, we may watch games and discuss strategies used, enabling students to talk about and learn about the sport. We hope that Stuyvesant students will be able to bond and form new friendships in our club as they will meet others with a similar interest in volleyball. Members and leaders will help each other learn and grow as volleyball players. Therefore, Stuy Volleyball is a great place to meet new friends and make lasting connections. 
",instagram: @stuyvolleyball,"Transfer of leadership and appointment of leadership positions are determined by members’ attendance and contributions to club meetings. The more meetings a member attends, the more experience they will gain in the sport and therefore the better equipped they will be to lead the club. The club will be led by one to three co-leaders. Any member that applies to become a leader is expected to show commitment and dedication to continuing the club’s mission. Perspective leaders are also expected to show strong leadership and teaching skills, demonstrate selflessness, as well as be friendly, approachable, and sociable. This can include attending meetings consistently, contributing to discussion, or leading demonstrations. In order for a member to apply to be a leader, they will first fill out an application form and then interviews will be conducted to determine the future leaders and/or co-leaders. The application process will occur once every semester, and leaders will be appointed as needed or when current leaders graduate. If a situation arises in which club members believe that the leaders should be removed or changed, a majority vote will determine the decision and club members will vote to appoint a new leader(s). 
","This club is unique because it is the only club at Stuyvesant that provides an environment for students to learn about and practice volleyball outside the pressures and commitment of the team. The club is a safe and friendly environment for those who are interested or experienced in volleyball. Members who are interested in the sport will be able to participate without having prior knowledge. Whereas the volleyball teams at Stuyvesant require an extensive and high commitment try-out process and season, the club is a great way for anyone to learn the sport. 
","Meetings will take place at least once every month. During the warmer months, meetings will occur up to once a week, as the weather is more suited for playing volleyball outdoors.

MSA also serves as a support system for Muslims where they can freely discuss Islam and its current standing in today’s news, as well as the contemporary issues and concerns faced by Muslims and Non-Muslims alike. There is even a designated prayer area for students who wish to pray during school hours and hold weekly Jummuah Jamaats. With the help of passionate members, this club strives to promote a better image of Islam for a widened understanding and an improvement in our own perspective lives. StuyMSA is more than just a religious club. It aims to create a safe environment for Muslims and non-Muslim students alike to share discussions and their viewpoints, and be as inclusive as possible. Furthermore, the MSA aims to address stereotypes and stigmas around the Muslim community. ","Meetings are discussion based, centered around topics, often for discussion, sometimes for didactic purposes. Media, such as videos, powerpoint presentations, and articles show different perspectives of Muslims and bring light to contemporary issues affecting the Muslim community. Social and community-service and volunteering type events such as food drives, Henna parties, Eid celebrations, and outdoor activities are held when appropriate (for example, during Islamic holidays). The MSA participates in the Muslim Interscholastic Tournament (MIST), an annual team competition for high school Muslim clubs throughout New York City, and subsequently on a national scale. School wide events, such as lectures held in a lecture hall, are also held when available. StuyMSA is also part of the Stuy UNITY Alliance with Stuy Black Students League, Stuy buildOn, Stuy Cancer Society, Stuy Free Hugs, Stuy Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Spectrum (GLASS), ASPIRA, Stuy Peer Partnership, Stuy Project Love, Stuy Red Cross, and Students Take Resolute Initiative to Vindicate the Environment.

We hope to garner more interest in rhythm games by establishing this club. For those who know about rhythm games, this is a place to bring together people with similar interests. Here, people of various skill levels can enjoy playing rhythm games together. Our members play rhythm games like osu!, Muse Dash, Cytus, Dynamix, and many more. We try to foster a competitive and cooperative space where we can have fun and improve our skill levels together. Our club can be a place to unwind in a place as stressful as Stuy. Playing rhythm games exposes people to new genres of music and improves several hand-eye coordination skills. Whether you are a casual or hardcore player, we hope that the members of this club will be able to appreciate rhythm games more, improve their skills, and have a good time.","Playing rhythm games involves several skills, like being able to react fast or having good eye-to-hand coordination, similar to a sport. Rhythm games will help to improve those skills and train people in rhythmic skills. Our club, not unlike other gaming clubs at Stuy, will promote a safe space where people will enjoy gaming together. People can play rhythm games alone, but playing together allows people to build friendships they would not have otherwise developed. Furthermore, because rhythm games require a certain amount of skill, experienced players can help new players ease into the game. Often, people are discouraged because the game seems too hard. However, new players can strive to be as proficient as their more skilled peers. By bringing together players of all skill levels, the Stuy Rhythm Games club is helping build a growth mindset for everybody. However, skill isn’t the only thing to be shared within the club. There are tons of rhythm games out there that are not necessarily mainstream. By being in a community of people who play rhythm games, one can receive more exposure to games they could like, regardless of their popularity. Rhythm games might be a little niche, but we hope to use that to our advantage and form a tight-knit community.",https://discord.gg/8F848xza9c,"We do not have one specific president or vice-president; we have a council of leaders. To get a position of power in the Stuy Rhythm Games Club, one should be active within the community. They should demonstrate that they can teach new players how to play rhythm games. A leader in a club like this is not just someone who can make decisions: they also should be someone who can guide others. The community can bring such an individual to the attention of the current leadership. From there, the people in charge may decide the fate of the individual. However, there may be too many people in power at one time. If this is the case, the current leadership may put the individual on a “waitlist.” If one leader becomes inactive, the other leaders will discuss the fate of the said person. A majority agreement among the other leaders will result in the demotion of that leader. If there is a tie, we can have a vote within the server if we should demote the inactive one. Leadership comes with responsibility, and they are not showing the attributes of a leader if they are not actively contributing. The waitlist can be referred to when choosing a replacement for the demoted leader.","We have noticed that although there has been a decent amount of people interested in rhythm games, no club exists for it. Rhythm games are unique in that they can seem easy on the surface but have an almost nonexistent skill ceiling. They offer a different style of gaming that doesn't always show up in the mainstream. Shooters are popular, but they can get stale pretty fast. Rhythm games provide a fresh take on gaming if people are tired of other competitive video games. For many of our members, rhythm games have not simply become an alternative to their most played titles, but their primary source of gaming, which speaks to how much potential these games carry. We hope to provide people with the opportunity to try these games and fall in love with them in the same way we have.","We will try to hold meets every Friday, given that enough people are interested.

Stuy K-Pop,stuy-kpop,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuy-kpop/14b4bc77,Stuy K-Pop’s mission is to promote an interest in K-Pop within Stuyvesant and provide K-Pop fans with opportunities and exposure to dancing.,"Stuy K-Pop's purpose is to create a community within the school that consists of members of different backgrounds who have a passion for Korean pop music and Korean music in general. The main focus of this club will be on teaching and learning choreography from a wide variety of girl groups and boy groups, such as BTS and BlackPink, and also co-ed groups and soloists. In addition to these workshops, there will be more relaxed meetings once in a while where members get together, listen to music, play games, watch Korean shows, etc. 

Members are expected to be respectful to each other and are highly encouraged to be active within the club's Facebook page. Generally, members will meet up approximately once every week to learn choreography from one of the leaders at the beginning of the year. However, members can show up to as many or as few meetings as desired. Later on, members can apply to teach choreography through a Google Form and video submission (details will be on the Facebook page). No dancing experience is necessary! ","Stuy K-Pop will benefit Stuyvesant because it creates a safe and welcoming community for all people who are interested in K-Pop. As the Korean music industry garners more and more popularity, not just in Korea but all across the world, more and more people, especially teenagers, also begin to develop an interest. Furthermore, people of all backgrounds are welcome to join Stuy K-Pop. As a result of this, Stuy K-Pop is creating a diverse community that is bonded together by a single factor: music. The Facebook page allows members to post any information/questions regarding K-Pop, keeping the community updated with the latest music (and sometimes drama, food, and other aspects of Korean culture). 

Stuy K-Pop is also mainly centered around the choreography of these songs. In hosting workshops, the club plans to introduce more students to dancing and help them prepare for showcases such as StuySquad and SOS. In addition, by giving members the opportunity to teach choreographies and direct a crew, Stuy K-Pop is providing them with experience for directorship before applying for the aforementioned showcases. Of course, dancing also promotes exercising and staying active! It's a good way to get a daily workout in while having fun and meeting other people who share similar interests! In a school that is constantly stressing the importance of academics, it is important for students to relieve their worries and relax through other means, such as dance and K-Pop. ",https://www.instagram.com/stuykpop/,"Either at the end of the previous year or the beginning of each year, the president will post in the Facebook group with a link to a Google Form, inviting any and all members to apply for a position (regardless of grade level). The form consists of questions asking about previous leadership experience, ideas to improve the club, qualities that would make the member a good fit for a position, etc., as well as a mandatory video of the member dancing a K-Pop choreo, seeing as all leaders are expected to teach and hold dance workshops. All leadership positions are assigned by the president(s) of that year but the president(s) may communicate and discuss with the previous leaders throughout the appointment process. All candidates, their responses to all questions, and their video submissions will be carefully read/looked over and considered by current leaders in order to choose the candidates best suited for a position. Leadership positions are announced before the start of the new school year on the club's Facebook page. If the president is to resign or graduate, the vice president(s) takes on the president position. All leaders of the club are expected to fulfill their roles (ie. teach and run club meetings, as well as manage and promote a safe and respectful environment during meetings and in the Facebook group). If any leader is noticed or reported for behavior that is negligent (such as failure to do the roles listed above), disrespectful, inappropriate, etc., the other leaders will investigate the situation accordingly. After consulting with the leader in question and all those involved, the other leaders will discuss and the majority vote will determine whether the leader will be impeached.

Members can also sign up to teach a choreography if they want to, but they must send in a video of them performing the choreography, which must be approved by a leader before they are allowed to teach.","Stuy K-Pop is unique because it is the only organization in Stuy that focuses on Korean pop music.

Stuy K-Pop is one of the few clubs that host regular workshops that promote dancing within the school in preparation for shows such as StuySquad and SOS, and just for having fun and staying active. Furthermore, Stuy K-Pop is open to people of all backgrounds, creating a club that is diverse and accepting of all those with an interest in K-Pop or Korean culture in general.","The club’s meeting schedule is approximately once a week, but open to adjustments in consideration of annual shows like StuySquad, SING!, and SOS.","['wednesday', 'friday']",low,"['kpop', 'dance', 'music']",,"Fiana Lin - President

Antares,antares,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/antares/ab1e95a3,"To promote science fiction/fantasy writing and art within the Stuyvesant community by producing one of the school's official literary magazines.
","Antares aims to bring together the many talented science fiction/fantasy artists and writers within Stuyvesant so that they can discuss and help develop each others' work, which culminates in the production of Antares magazine in the spring. Antares is also an attractive publication for those interested in magazine promotion and layout, and there are many different ways to become involved in the publication. Members are expected to attend meetings regularly and contribute to the magazine either through writing, editing, drawing, layout/design, or promotion. In producing the magazine, we aim to showcase the creativity of the Stuyvesant community both within the school and in the community through outreach efforts with book stores such as the local Barnes and Noble. Aside from the publication, Antares has also become a club for science fiction/fantasy enthusiasts and our meetings are often where lively book or movie discussions take place. Often, members work on their creative work during meetings or discuss ideas.
","Antares can serve as an important creative outlet for Stuyvesant students who like to read, write, or draw while giving them valuable experience in producing a publication. In a demanding school such as Stuyvesant, it is vitally important that students find enjoyable ways of taking a break from academics and exercising their imaginations, and Antares offers the chance to do exactly that while producing a literary work of which the school can be proud. Stuyvesant students and faculty alike will be able to enjoy the amazing art and writing produced by the members of Antares, which we think is a self-explanatory benefit. In addition, students who are interested in creative or business fields can gain valuable experience in a multitude of ways by becoming involved in the magazine. We have opportunities to gain experience in selling advertising, promoting the magazine and the club, editing, writing, illustrating, and developing other art forms. Members will also get useful skills involving collaboration and communication, especially when it comes to editing and critique, or collaborative pieces among members of Antares. Often, members will develop creative ideas within the club and in the past, several members have then entered their work in the Scholastic art and writing competition and have won awards for their work. Also, we hope to promote Stuyvesant within the local community through our club.",,"Each year's leaders are responsible for appointing the next year's leaders. Leaders are chosen based on demonstrated level of commitment to the magazine (through writing, drawing, editing, or other business-related activities) and club and leadership qualities, such as the ability to listen and give constructive feedback, run meetings and events, and get things done. Leaders meet and discuss candidates and take a vote before asking various members to fill roles. We have a ""three strikes"" system where every time a member of the Board abuses their position for non-club-related purposes, they receive a strike. The Board will vote on whether or not the Board member gets a strike. After three strikes, the Board member will be removed from the Board, regardless of their position. Members are expected to understand that final editorial decisions regarding which stories and drawings will appear in the magazine rest with the magazine’s Editor-in-Chief and Executive Editor. In return, the magazine’s editors strive to be inclusive and include as many pieces in the magazine as they reasonably can, given space and cost restraints.
","Antares is an unusual high school publication in that it focuses exclusively on science fiction and fantasy. Our magazine has also won multiple awards in recent years, including a Columbia Press Association Gold Medal and the National Scholastic Press Association First Class Award, and we hope to win more in the future. In addition, past writers have won Scholastic Art and Writing medals for their individual work. Although our main focus is producing the magazine, we also see ourselves as a community of science fiction/fantasy fans, and in the past year we began new efforts to promote our club through social media and the production and sale of attractive T-shirts that featured one of our member’s artwork. Starting this year, we hope to marshal the collective talent and brains of all Antares members, and produce a huge collaborative project that all the members can hopefully be proud of.
",Our meeting schedule varies throughout the school year. ,['friday'],medium,"['writing', 'art', 'antares']","Antares originated at Stuyvesant way back in the 1970s and continued through the 1980s before becoming defunct. In 2014, it was brought back to life by Stuyvesant students. For four years, we have helped keep a Stuyvesant tradition alive and the publication is beloved by students, teachers, and alumni. We hope to continue doing so well into the future.","Julian Huang - Creator

South Asian Media and Entertainment,SouthAsianME,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/SouthAsianME/b3c56f16,The South Asian Media Club aims to delve deeper into South Asian culture by studying how it is portrayed in media. ,"The South Asian Media club’s purpose is to create a community where South Asian culture is appreciated. This club is not limited to South Asian students, in fact, students of all ethnicities are encouraged to join to learn more about their South Asian peers. The club will be looking at and discussing different South Asian media such as, but not limited to, movies, novels, poetry, art, games, and music. This is an interactive club where the members will be able to voice their opinions and provide suggestions about club activities they are interested in. The club will meet every other Friday after school. This is a low commitment club and members will not be required to attend every meeting. There will be special meetings during holidays where members will be able to learn more about the significance and traditions of the holiday while celebrating with their peers. Our club will serve as the Stuyvesant charter for the South Asian Media and Entertainment organization. We will plan events in both NYC and Stuyvesant at club meetings. ","South Asian media is slowly becoming more popular, especially with the immigration of many South Asian families to America. However, South Asian media is still widely ridiculed, making people reluctant to share their love for it. South Asians are barely portrayed in Hollywood and when they are, are suppressed by stereotypes, making many South Asian students distance themselves from their culture. Additionally, South Asia is often depicted as a poor and dirty region while, in reality, it is rich with culture and history. This includes diverse fashion, music, architecture, religion, languages, food, etc. The South Asian Media club serves to create a comfortable community where people can express their love for South Asian culture without being ostracized. The club will also allow other students to learn more about their peers’ culture, which will help them become more open to and interested in South Asian culture, creating a friendlier environment. The goal of the club is to spread information about South Asian culture to non-South Asians as well, so they can take an initiative to explore the culture further on their own. Furthermore, the club hopes to give members a chance to de-stress from the academic pressure of high school by providing members with an environment where they can relax and make new friends.",Insta @southasianme,"When there is a leadership position open, the leaders of the club will send out an application that members will fill out if they want to run for a certain position. The application will be reviewed and filtered by the current leaders until the top candidates are deduced. Dedication to the club will be taken into consideration, since the new leaders would need a good understanding of how the club runs as well as be knowledgeable enough to guide the members. The top candidates will be interviewed by the leaders. After the interviews, leaders will discuss together and then vote on the best candidate(s). The members of the club can vote to impeach a leader at any time if they feel the leader has done something wrong or is constantly missing club activities without a proper excuse. If 75% of the club votes to impeach a leader for a good reason, they will be removed. ","The South Asian Media club is unique because while there are other South Asian clubs, there is no other club at Stuyvesant that focuses solely on the media aspect of South Asian culture. The media is an essential tool that can help people learn more about culture, but is often overlooked. Media like books, movies, and music can tell us a lot about how society works in certain regions while also allowing us to enjoy ourselves.",The South Asian Media club will meet every other Friday after school from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM. Students can come any time they want and do not have to stay for the full duration of the meeting. Feel free to drop by anytime you want and just have fun!

Stuyvesant Girl Up,stuyvesantgirlup,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyvesantgirlup/07e5ea44,"Stuyvesant Girl Up is a club that educates students on female empowerment and topics relating to gender inequality. 
","In the world that we live in, disparities in women's education, lack of opportunities for women, and violence towards women has become increasingly prevalent. And many other women in many other third-world countries suffer the effects of these inequalities on a much larger scale. At Stuyvesant Girl Up, we educate people of all genders about the problems in this world that haunt women, and we use our knowledge to induce a change in our Stuyvesant community. Through fundraising, presentations, and more, our goal is to not only educate people, but to give women the confidence to change the world. Stuyvesant Girl Up is a branch of the larger organization Girl Up, which is partnered with the United Nations Foundation. Girl Up reaches women on a global scale, and has impacted over 50,000 girls throughout this process. If you want to make an impact in your community for the better, join us on our mission to equality and empowerment, one woman at a time. 
","This activity will provide students with the opportunity to not only learn more about important issues that impact women, but also very helpful skills that are applicable for any scenario. Girl Up teaches skills of fundraising, organizing, advocating and storytelling. Oftentimes, when applying to leadership positions, students are expected to know and uphold the qualities of a successful leader. Many, however, may not have the experience or the natural ability to stand out and let their voices be heard. Girl Up not only provides real life scenarios for students to develop their skills, but also helps strengthen their ability to stand up and speak for themselves while still becoming an efficient manager. It will form a new generation of Stuyvesant students that not only understand and sympathize with the problems of women throughout the past and present, but will be able to create solutions of a future that’s brighter for everyone. Girl Up connects clubs throughout the world, ensuring an effective and strong foundation for all members. The organization has specific goals and rules in mind, making sure that every club, member and volunteer is actively involved, allowing for efficient communication and effective change. The large base of volunteers and members from across the globe provides a support system for the school that allows for connections to be developed in areas that are rarely reached. Without the leadership and unity behind the thousands of members, clubs like these that attempt to create change may lack the organization and planning needed.With Girl Up, results are seen, and the members know that their hard work is leading to a bright and hopeful future. Coming out of each club meeting, you will become a more informed, well-educated individual that has a lot of information about female rights and how to create a better and safer society for women.
","@stuyvesantgirlup, https://www.facebook.com/groups/671991840340906","The Stuyvesant Girl Up board includes at least five members, as required by the larger Girl Up entity. These roles include, but are not limited to, President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Public Relations Officer. In order to foster a democracy in which everyone is represented, we will use a popular vote system to impeach any current leaders of the club or elect a member of the club to the board. We would be making polls after each meeting that not only gives the members a place to express their thoughts about the meeting, but also to give the members a space to tell us if the leaders are doing a good job in their roles. With this information, the board can make changes accordingly. As Stuyvesant Girl Up gets larger and has more members, the board will collectively decide to add different positions to the board, like grade representatives, so that every grade and age feels included. In order for a member to have this leadership position, the candidates would first have to submit an official statement saying they will run for the position, and then deliver a speech to the club about what they would do with this position. Lastly, there would be a blind vote to ensure the fairness of the election. If someone proposes to impeach anyone in a leadership position, they will be required to provide a logical explanation for why they think the officer deserves to be removed from office. There must also be support from at least two other members. If so, members all vote for it, and if the popular vote passes, the person is expected to step down. This applies to all cabinet members, including vice president and president. No one is exempt from the protocols, even if they hold the highest leadership position. If someone in the cabinet resigns before the end of the school year, elections will be held for that position for any interested members to apply. If a student(s) on the cabinet graduates, elections will be held in the spring for the next year. They should maintain contact through emails and other means with other members of the club in an appropriate manner and time, and should participate in any and all club organized functions and activities unless otherwise stated. Nevertheless, participation is key to the success of developing effective and outstanding members of society.
","Stuyvesant Girl Up is unique, because it not only educates people about gender inequality, it teaches them how to become better leaders. Girl Up has four main categories of leadership tools: Advocacy, Fundraising, Storytelling, and Organizing. Through teaching these topics, you can become a more confident changemaker, and use these methods to develop your public speaking skills in general. Also, by being a part of this club, you are joining a large community of kids just like you who are dedicated to making a difference in the world.

The bright seventh grade students you'll be working with hail from schools including Girls Prep, Boys Prep, and, our long-time partner, Dock Street, just to name a few. Although the main role of participants is to teach students, past members have expanded their roles by volunteering to help create packets, lesson plans, and even teach the entire class at times (completely optional). In the off-season, we will implement simple projects that we can send out to affiliated schools in order to show middle-schoolers around and about Stuyvesant. Tutees of our program have left with close mentorship and increased confidence in test-taking, specifically catered toward the Specialized High School Admissions Test. Tutors frequently come out of the program with a deeper understanding of communication, teaching experience with younger students, and even the desire to pursue a career in education.","Stuy Prep is one of Stuyvesant High School's oldest tutoring programs, and it continues to expand its outreach to prospective Stuyvesant students. This program supports the success of traditionally underrepresented students, whether defined by race, socio-economic background, and/or being first-generation. In short, Stuy Prep is an accessible gateway into the specialized high schools that provide a wealth of opportunities even beyond graduation. Tutors who are also members of Key Club, Red Cross, and/or ARISTA are given volunteer hours or credits from actively attending Stuy Prep's weekly meetings. More importantly, however, tutors are given the opportunity to connect with their tutees and other tutors, gaining a deeper insight into how to communicate more effectively and how volunteering can be a wonderful and rewarding experience. With two sessions every year and a summer session run by Stuyvesant alumni, there are several opportunities throughout the year for students to get engaged and discover new passions in teaching or strengthen old ones. Even those who are not interested in pursuing a career specifically in teaching will learn how to work in groups, engage with different age groups (from adult faculty to younger tutees), and remain consistent and responsible. Members may even find themselves joining the group of alumni that fund and support Stuy Prep in the future.",,"Leaders are appointed when a senior board member graduates. There are four leadership positions that will be open by the end of this year: President (oversees all operations), Vice President of Tutoring (teaches the entire class and the basis of the lesson at the beginning of sessions), Vice President of Logistics (reaches out to schools for partnerships and ensures that emails get sent/checked), and Secretary (general exec board duties/takes attendance). Gaining a position on the board means working together effectively and taking on all three roles at once in many cases (high commitment). Prospective board members are expected to submit an application and interview for a specific position of interest.. Leaders are expected to attend every meeting, show up on time, and be proactive in improving Stuy Prep. Above all, board members are selected based on past attendance, their display of passion in written responses, and preparedness for the interview. In the case that board members rarely show up to meetings for no excusable reason, they can be removed from their position based on the decision of the other board members.","Stuy Prep has remained a quality form of supplementary education for middle school students who may not have the financial resources to pay for SHSAT prep classes, which can be $1000+. The program promotes equity in the public education system, bridging the gap between students of different socio-economic and racial backgrounds. There is power in accessibility: the choice to attend whatever school a child dreams of, furthering their education and continued access to educational resources. Furthermore, it is an experience for middle school students to meet with students from other schools and make new friends.

","Stuy Women in Science aims to unite females who are interested in pursuing a career in science. Science has a wide range of topics including biology and chemistry. The club will engage our members in presentations and meaningful discussions about different science occupations that can be pursued. During discussions, members can bring in new careers that they would like to learn more about. Based on statistics by the American Association of University Women, only 28% of STEM workers are women. Unfortunately, many women are underrepresented in STEM fields and establishing Stuy Women in Science at Stuyvesant High School aims to seal the gender gap in STEM. In this club, we learn about different science careers that is male-dominated and through guest speaker events, we learn how women can overcome discrimination in these fields. This club not only includes a specific group into the STEM community, it sets a pathway for women to pursue careers in STEM. It empowers women to make great achievements, without any limitations. This club also emphasizes that the world must be accepting towards all groups, regardless of gender. This organization will close the gender gap in science-related careers, widen the career options by providing more insight into the science field, and will help influence the decisions students may take if they decide to major in science. There will be games, guest-speaker events, videos, and fun projects to help better understand the many career options in science. Members of the club are expected to attend meetings and are encouraged to ask questions about any science career they are interested in. 
","Stuy Women in Science will benefit the Stuyvesant community because it will acknowledge science careers that have a major, and beneficial, impact in our society. Many students in Stuyvesant may be unaware of these various, yet amazing, opportunities in this developing world. Stuyvesant students will be benefiting from this club because it provides a group with a common interest. This club will create a sense of community, as well as help build connections, by encouraging many young women to enter into the science field. This organization will strengthen Stuyvesant’s female students by igniting their passion, raising their voice, and building teamwork skills that would help them in their careers. This club will also provide tutoring for students who are struggling in a science course. In addition, students may receive extra credit from science teachers if they are interested in attending guest speaker events. Any questions about a specific topic pertaining to science are welcome! Furthermore, this club will suggest science-related opportunities within our community that many students can participate in. Many women are still underrepresented in the science field, but this club would help expand and provide more opportunities that women may choose. All in all, Stuy Women in Science hopes to set a pathway for many individuals who are still deciding on the careers in science they hope to pursue.

Students interested in the medical field should consider joining the Radiology specialization in medical school! Radiology is a specialization that is dedicated to using X-rays and other high-energy radiation for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. These scans can diagnose a small fracture to a tumor in the human body. Members will learn how to use X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound. Members will also learn how to identify and diagnose diseases or abnormalities between the scanned images. Furthermore, members will also learn safety techniques when handling radiology equipment. There might be trips planned to Radiology Medical Institutes so members can learn about the role of a radiologist in the hospital. In addition, guest speaker events will be planned to learn about the pathway needed to become a radiologist!


","Stuy Radiology will benefit the Stuyvesant community because it will focus on a specific specialization within the various medical field options. There are many students at Stuyvesant High School that are inclined to join a career related to STEM. Within that group, many desire to be physicians. Instead of a general club dedicated to physicians, Stuy Radiology will bring people with a specific interest together! Stuy Radiology ties knowledge stemming from both biology and physics in order to diagnose the abnormalities between different scans. The use of critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning would be sharpened when participating in this club which is a great characteristic when dealing with challenging courses at Stuyvesant High School. In addition, through the multiple guest speaker events/lectures containing potential mentors, this club will help establish connections with world-renowned surgeons, college professors, and researchers! This club aims to educate the Stuyvesant community about the role of radiology in the world, in order to set a pathway for the next generation of aspiring radiologists. Students will also learn about different internship opportunities available, different courses, and schools dedicated to radiology. In addition, students may receive extra credit during guest speaker events! It is important to learn about the safety techniques when it comes to radiation in everyday items. Aside from gaining medical knowledge, Stuy Radiology will also teach its members' safety techniques to avoid being exposed to harmful electromagnetic waves that can be produced in everyday objects. Through presentations, projects, and fun lectures, the knowledge of radiology will benefit the Stuyvesant community in these ways.

STC is student-led and welcomes anyone who is interested in theater, providing all members with technical and performance-based opportunities in multiple theatrical areas. Crews include Cast, Band, Stage, Tech, Lights and Sound, Art, Costumes, Props, and many more. In our predominantly STEM-motivated environment, the arts provide an important alternate outlet for expression, and STC is proud to be a home for many creative Stuyvesant students. No experience is needed to join, but members are expected to be dedicated to their crew or crews by consistently attending rehearsals, maintaining academic achievement, demonstrating respect towards leaders and faculty advisors, and being present at shows and clean-up days. STC's home base in the Stuyvesant building is the Murray Kahn Theater and its adjoining Costumes and Tech rooms, and all members are expected to behave well and respect these spaces while working in them. The full Participation Contract can be found at http://stuytheater.weebly.com/forms.html.
","Besides providing the student body with a welcoming space to engage in the world of theater, STC enriches the general Stuyvesant community by offering entertainment at little to no cost to students, teachers, administration, and families. Our three shows run for three nights each, giving Stuyvesant community members ample opportunity to attend each performance. We also offer a variety of leadership positions, whether it be through directing or producing a show or running a technical crew. These experiences help students build skills in leadership and collaboration, which can be applied to future participation in the arts or other areas. STC members are additionally well-equipped to participate in SING!, a non-STC affiliated annual school-wide competition where SophFrosh, Juniors, and Seniors write, produce, and perform their own hourlong musicals. STC also connects students with other theatrical and performance-based opportunities throughout the year, both inside and outside of Stuyvesant. Participating in STC has encouraged members to take part in programs run by organizations such as HBO, Wingspan Arts, New York Theater Workshop, NYU Steinhardt, The Juilliard School, National Children’s Chorus, Brooklyn Youth Chorus, From Home Theater, and many others. On the whole, STC members learn from and teach one another, giving students an essential and vastly different experience from the rest of their school day.

STC will be led by Slate, a group of five to six representatives chosen by the previous year’s Slate in the spring to fulfill their duties the following year. Slate will be selected with no external counsel from any party other than the members of Slate. Slate will consist of three Executive Producers, who will oversee the production of each show; a Director of Communications, who will manage social media platforms and advertise events; and one or two Technical Coordinators, who will oversee the technical aspects of each show and the theater in general. The general hierarchy of any STC show is: Executive Producer over Slate over Producers over Cast Directors over Other Directors. For each production, Producers and Cast Directors are chosen by Slate through an application and interview process open to all students who maintain an 85% or above school average and have no failing classes or less than two ""needs improvement"" classes (a grade-based standard which applies to all STC members). STC members of all levels will also be asked to resign if any egregious behavior is exhibited (reference our STC contract for more details- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c5tM6jq_TpYVIX6ztLW3zij8L0gMvAGSLVHb8BSmpy4/edit?usp=sharing) For more specifics and any questions, email stuytheater@gmail.com or visit our website.

Students are responsible for creating a show from only librettos and sheet music, leaving the rest of the creative process up to members of various crews. In comparison to most other high school dramatic organizations, members of STC have much more freedom, as well as responsibility, in all areas of production, allowing them to move onto college or professional organizations with an exceptional level of experience. 
","While STC has three high-commitment seasons (Fall, Winter and Spring), participation in all is not required, and members can choose their level of involvement. Rehearsals and crew meetings are generally held on every school day of a production cycle, which lasts from 4-6 weeks every Fall, Winter and Spring. Before each cycle, there are two weeks of pre-production, including one week during which Cast Directors and Producers are chosen, and one week of auditions/crew recruitments. 2-4 weekend rehearsals are held per show, usually lasting for the length of two or more rehearsals, and taking place on one day of the weekend. For each crew, it is at the discretion of the directors which crew members are needed on certain days, so commitment varies based on crew and role in said crew. While daily rehearsals will usually last around two hours, during each production’s three show days, performers and technical crew members will be expected to stay later into the evenings.","['monday', 'wednesday', 'friday', 'thursday', 'tuesday']",high,"['theater', 'music', 'art']","Please email stuytheater@gmail.com with any questions, or join our Facebook group for more information!

At this club, one can expect to discuss anything about Marvel, from opinions to predictions about upcoming projects to recently-released projects. Each meeting will have a specific purpose, whether it is theorizing, discussion of an episode or movie, or even simply discussing thoughts about the MCU or the Marvel comics. While commitment is fairly low and there are very few meetings in a month, attending said meetings is completely optional for the general member! This club strives to create a calm and even playful environment for any Marvel fans, so members should not worry about their attendance. Members are encouraged to contribute their own ideas and theories, so long as it aligns with the meeting’s original purpose(s). Finally, members are expected to follow basic rules, including being respectful to each other and their views.","Marvel is such a huge fandom, and it is so important for members of fandoms to come together! The Stuyvesant Marvel club is an opportunity for students of all grades and different backgrounds to be able to connect with each other via mutual interests and escape from the stressful atmosphere that could thrive in school. The club can be a catalyst for new students to be able to create relationships and express themselves to an engaging and accepting environment. It is also a way for students to be more involved in the school community without having to be forced to stay inside of Stuyvesant for extra hours and arrive home afterwards at harmful times for them to sustain a proper schedule. The club will also be able to help encourage members to analyze and dissect media in thought-provoking and in-depth discussions about Marvel movies and Marvel comics. Most importantly, the club is a source of entertainment as there may be game nights where members can engage in trivia games such as a Marvel-themed Jeopardy or Kahoots online. There are endless possibilities for students to engage in the giant worldwide phenomenon of Marvel and celebrate the 80+ year history of Marvel Entertainment.",instagram.com/stuymarvel,"At the beginning of the school year, a Google form will be sent out via the Stuyvesant Facebook groups for people to apply for leadership positions. This includes a social media outreach director (who makes posts to promote the club and meetings) and a news director (person who researches events in the fandom, like news, panels, and new releases). The presidents will choose the best people for the positions based on the responses to the form. A strike system will be used to determine if a leader should be impeached: if a leader is disrespectful or doesn’t attend a meeting (without notifying one of the presidents with a valid reason) they would earn one strike. If they get three strikes, their leadership position would be revoked or they would be removed from the club. A valid reason for a leader not to attend a meeting includes, but is not limited to, illness, too much schoolwork, an exam to study for, auditions, rehearsals, and mandatory commitments for other extracurriculars. As for members, they are simply expected to be respectful and act appropriately, and if they do not comply with these simple rules, they will earn a strike. Similarly to leaders, after three strikes, they will be removed from the club.","This club, and Marvel in general, is very multifaceted! In this club, fans can find something for everyone, be it in-depth discussions or simply info about comics or upcoming projects. This club is a place where Marvel fans can come together and enjoy what they love, in a very casual and calm place. Communication is encouraged between members and leaders alike, so members of this club can also expect to build strong bonds with fellow fans.","Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we will try to meet at least once or twice a month remotely through communication platforms, depending on project releases and availability of the members.","['thursday', 'friday']",low,"['comics', 'movies', 'remote']",,"Alice Dan - Co-president

Stuy Choreo,stuychoreo,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuychoreo/0204dbfa,We aim to provide an environment and community for students to immerse themselves in the creating and learning choreography.,"Stuy Choreo is a club centered around choreographing and learning dance. While much of our influence has been from hip-hop, our choreography can be influenced by all genres and styles, depending on the choreographer. At Stuy Choreo, we host workshops featuring choreography created by artists within the Stuyvesant dance community. Through seasonal classes, we help both aspiring and experienced dancers grow, and provide a judgment-free space for them to learn from other dancers or unleash their own creativity! In addition to dancing, we discuss culture, foundations, and our own interests around dance and choreography. We also share opportunities for dancers to grow outside of the club and connect them with the dance community outside of Stuyvesant High School. Members of the club may attend meetings on their own accord. There are no requirements or restrictions in becoming a member of Stuy Choreo. Our only rules are for members to be supportive and friendly to others, and to attend with an open mind!","Stuy Choreo provides dancers and artists with a judgment-free space to explore dance and the world around it. For choreographers, Stuy Choreo offers opportunities to lead workshops, enabling them to exercise their creativity, practice teaching and public speech, and help other students grow. For aspiring dancers, Stuy Choreo creates a beginner-friendly environment to introduce dancers of all levels to choreography with zero pressure to commit. For all members, Stuy Choreo is a place to find a community, and to meet and have fun with others who share the same interest in dance. More importantly, it is a place to unwind from stress and school through movement and music. Most dance classes outside are costly, can be intimidating to sign up for, or are at inconvenient times, especially for busy students during the school year. However, Stuy Choreo creates similar environments right in our own school building (and in this case, online), and they are free. In addition, Stuy Choreo helps dancers prepare for student productions at Stuyvesant, such as Stuy Squad, SING!, and SOS by hosting meetings in the off-season. From a social perspective, Stuy Choreo is also a contributor against the impression that students in Stuyvesant High School are only intellectuals. We enable students to explore outside of academics into the world of performing arts.",https://www.instagram.com/stuychoreo / https://www.facebook.com/groups/stuychoreo,"Leaders and board members are elected by previous leaders through yearly applications. There are no restrictions or requirements to apply, but candidacy will be judged by an applicant’s ability to lead the club, manage logistics, and contribute to the community in line with our mission, as determined by previous boards. Leaders can be replaced or reconsidered if they fail or do not attempt to facilitate the club as described above. Leaders can and will also be impeached if they are found to be disrupting the safe space created for artists and dancers at Stuy Choreo.
While there are no specific rules for members, all attendees are always expected to be supportive and non-judgemental, both during and outside of Stuy Choreo meetings. If any members are found behaving inappropriately at Stuy Choreo meetings or in the Stuy Choreo Facebook group, they will be banned from both club meetings and the online group. This includes, but is not limited to, bullying, teasing, harassment, and discrimination.","While Stuy Choreo is not the only dance club, our highlight is our focus on sharing creativity. Despite our hip-hop influence, we do not limit our members to one style and instead, encourage exploration. The community within Stuy Choreo is connected to the Stuyvesant dance community: numerous productions and associations within Stuyvesant, such as Stuy Squad, SING!, SOS, and outside Stuyvesant. The network created by current members and a very large body of alumni connects members to a greater dance community beyond the walls of Stuyvesant. This allows members to be even more inspired to continue dancing and choreographing even after their time in high school.","We plan to meet at least once or twice a month, but more meetings can be added based on how many people there are who want to share choreography.

Architecture Club and Drafting Help,architectureclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/architectureclub/1653f034,"This club is dedicated to teaching the in's and out's of architecture through designing, creating model structures, and gaining experience from pros. ","The purpose of Architecture Club is to provide an opportunity for students to further explore architecture outside of their mandatory drafting class in sophomore or junior year. People that enjoy drafting class may find that a single semester is too short to thoroughly absorb all the information and possibilities the topic offers. Architecture Club intends to allow students with a passion or interest in the subject to expand on the knowledge learned in class through our model building projects, problem-solving designs and experience from guest speakers. Every week, the club will hold two meetings: a mandatory meeting on Mondays and an optional meeting on Wednesdays (which will be mandatory on certain weeks). We will guide students through a process where they plan, design, and create architectural models. 

We want our members to
 1. Learn something about architecture or other design-related careers. 
 2. Examine current problems in the world and how architecture can change them. 
 3. Be respectful to guest speakers, leaders, and each other. 
 4. And lastly, have fun!","This activity will introduce students to different aspects of architecture including, but not limited to, design, measurement, and model construction. The projects we work on in our club will enable students to be introduced to things they may not be already learning in class but have an interest in for their future careers. These activities also provide students with more material for their portfolios that are crucial to getting into an architecture or art college. In addition to providing an environment where students can release their stress, any student wishing to work after-school on drafting assignments or with difficulties with drafting may come in and ask for advice. Assisting students that come in for drafting support allows them to expand their understanding of the course, help them improve their grades and quality of assignments, and increase their enjoyment of the drafting course, as well as architecture in general. Students that think they are not good at drafting and/or the assignments involved often feel that they are at a disadvantage compared to other students in the course, but our club will enable them to find the support they need to enhance their skills and proficiency. Students with excellent drafting skills can use this activity as an outlet to express their interest in the subject and utilize their skills to produce more advanced work. Moreover, all students can learn and acquire knowledge in the area of architecture, building, and creating ideas with other students.",,"Leaders must show up at least once every 2 mandatory meets (Mondays) and at least once every 4 optional meets (Wednesdays). If leaders do not follow these rules they will be stripped of their rank or suspended until further notice. Leaders are appointed at the end of the year by graduating leaders based on their knowledge of drafting and architecture, as well as their responsibility and ability to lead other members through a classroom-style meeting. Members must show up once every 2 mandatory meets or they will be dropped from the club. At the end of the meeting, all materials that were distributed MUST be put back where they were found. If anyone borrows materials from the other drafting rooms, they must take the responsibility of returning them by themselves. In addition, if any student takes advantage of the drafting help by playing on the computers, they will be removed from the room and their teacher will be notified.","We teach members the design process going into a structure that is being built, including planning, layout, and the actual construction. We also discuss our structural plans as a group in order to share ideas and come up with original ideas. We will be having showcases within the group to present our work. In addition, we will be providing extra help to drafting students and teach them about technical drawing outside of what is taught in our drafting classes.","Every Monday we will have a mandatory meeting for members, but there will occasionally be Wednesday meetings in order to allot more time for our projects.

Stuy Startup,stuystartup,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuystartup/80445fc2,Providing members with real life entrepreneurship experience. Leadership has experience winning business competitions and starting businesses.,"The goal of Stuy Startup is to form a community of business minded students, with or without experience, to learn and execute establishing businesses together. The club aims to provide a learning environment for club members to learn how to start a business from developing their opportunities, to brainstorming business ideas, to creating their first prototypes, to test marketing, and finally bringing their products onto the open market. Club leaders will share business formation basics and key processes - such as forming the perfect team as well as subtle details such as the process of naming the brand - and like-minded students can gather to work together and eventually launch as business partners. Another one of the club's goals is joining business competitions. Stuy Startup's leadership team has experience winning global business competitions, such as placing in the North America Finals of the Tiger Global Case competition, the top 5% of the 1,155 teams worldwide from 70+ countries. With this experience, leadership aims to teach members essential skills for cracking businesses case studies and entrepreneurship competitions.
","Business minded students at Stuyvesant can take some classes that will teach them about business and economics. However, those who want to pursue a more in-depth understanding of the field would get a more authentic and engaging experience from starting their own business. While learning solely from an academic standpoint might prepare students for the business world, students often do not have the opportunity to apply their knowledge. By joining Stuy Startup, students will be able to work as a team as they develop their business. They will develop the business with many tasks including bouncing ideas off of each other as well as discovering and utilizing effective marketing strategies. Members will learn from each other along the way and be prepared for their future in the business world. Starting a business by oneself may be intimidating to many students here at Stuyvesant High School. A club where students are able to truly pursue their passion for business for the first time (or add to their past experience) by gaining actual exposure will establish a great foundation for their future careers. After building this solid foundation together, students of the Stuyvesant community will learn how to operate and maintain a successful business.",,"Stuy Startup has 2 co-presidents and 1 vice president. Though the co-president and vice president positions have been taken, they will be passed to members of the organization that we find to be dedicated, hard-working, and have done much for the club's growth. At the end of the year, the co and vice presidents will shortlist to a few candidates for the opening positions. From there, an application for the positions will also be given out to each candidate consisting of 4 written-response questions in a google form. There will also be an interview for each leadership position mentioned before. The process of obtaining leadership will carry over between school years when the positions open up. Stuy Startup is also looking for a marketing team, which will consist of a Director of Outreach and a group of 2-3 people to spread the word about the club and see its growth. Again, these positions will be appointed through a google form and interview. Impeachment Procedures: If any club leader neglects their responsibilities or demonstrates improper behavior, a discussion will be held among other club leaders to determine the punishment. A lower level offense will result in a warning, while worse will end in impeachment. Punishment, including up to impeachment, is determined by majority vote of non-violating club leaders. A replacement will then be appointed through the standard application and interview.
","What makes Stuy Startup unique is that rather than just teaching their members classroom concepts of business startups, the club envisions having like-minded students actually form businesses in order to strengthen their relationships and confidence regarding entrepreneurship. Stuy Startup will still begin with learning basic classroom concepts of starting up a business, but will then pivot towards execution, something that is not commonly found in business courses at school. Leadership at Stuy Startup is also unique because it actually has proven experience in business competitions and entrepreneurship. From reaching the North America Finals of a global business competition, to actually starting a clothing company, there's a lot of viable experience that Stuy Startup's 2 co-presidents and vice president can share.

Stuyvesant Fortuna,fortuna,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/fortuna/0e974b43,Stuyvesant Fortuna aims to teach students different fortune telling techniques and to inform them about their background and the culture behind them.,"Stuyvesant Fortuna is dedicated to enriching interested students’ knowledge of the background and culture behind various fortune telling techniques. Fortune telling has been often seen by the public as a hoax, which has heightened over recent years, as misinformation and negative views on it began to spread throughout social media platforms. Such misinformation includes tarot card readings, which show up on millions of people’s pages and claim the reading is for them, despite their inaccuracies. The background behind it is often overlooked and never mentioned, hence resulting in its wrongful use and interpretation. Therefore, we plan to educate others on the origin and spread of such processes through slideshows of gathered information and hands-on practices, which allows them to unlock the answers they desire to the lingering questions in their minds. Our agenda includes us teaching the lesser-known methods, such as Kau Chim, broadening the views of our members beyond mainstream fortune-telling ways. We hope our members can learn and use the various techniques later in life as assisting tools or as lighthearted entertainment for family and friends!","Stuyvesant students are known to be interested and talented in areas of math and science, which are usually supported through lists of statistics and formulas. However, they rarely dabble into “unexplainable science,” including fortune-telling, as they believe it is a form of party entertainment and they will not gain any benefits from involving themselves in it. Our club aims to broaden the interests of these students, possibly breeding new passions. We will show students how to not limit themselves to a certain category of science and have fun while doing so. Our club will begin our first lessons on popular Western methods and then move on to different methods around the world. In our meetings, members will be able to try out the different methods and hopefully get answers to the questions that are lingering on their minds. Along the way, we will also be giving a quick course into the history and culture that is behind it, hoping that it will bring students of all backgrounds together through the connection of cultures. We will be the first club in Stuyvesant to be centered around fortune-telling and we hope we can usher in a new era of divination in the future. ",https://www.instagram.com/stuyfortuna/,"Within Stuyvesant Fortuna, there can be president, vice president, social media manager, and webmaster positions. These leaders will be determined through an application sent out at the beginning of the semester. Members can vote on whom they want to be in charge of a specific position. Anyone is welcome to apply however dedication plays a huge role in the final decision since people who show up to more meetings will have more knowledge about this club than people who do not. Everyone is expected to behave civilly in the club and club members who mock ancient traditions, disrespect other members, etc. will receive one strike. If they reach two strikes, they will be talked to by the leaders and possibly expelled from the club [depending on the severity of their actions]. If the perpetrator is a leader, they will be impeached after two strikes and kicked out if there are any more occurrences. Transfers of powers will occur if the current leaders have not been performing their duties to the best of their abilities, if they step down, or if they graduate. The new leaders will be people voted by the members of the club.","Stuyvesant Fortuna will be the first to specialize in tarot reading and other different types of fortune-telling methods around the world. We would be able to read anyone’s fortunes, whether it be a fortune about their future careers, love life, success in the future, or anything else in their heart’s desire. Different instructors will educate the club members on the cultural backgrounds of fortune-telling and how to follow it accordingly.

During most meetings, members will simply be able to play against other members in friendly matches. Super Stuy Bros is open to both casual and competitive players. For anyone simply looking for other students with a similar passion for Smash or any fighting game, this club hopes to serve as the place to find those people. We hope to create a fun and relaxing community that allows students to forget about school and simply enjoy the things they love. This year, Super Stuy Bros is branching out to include the entire FGC. If you don't play Smash, but enjoy other games in the genre or more traditional fighting games, feel free to join!

Although Club Leaders will bring at least one setup to connect to the Smart Board, members are expected to bring their own devices/controllers. The setup connected to the Smart Board is usually reserved for 8 player free-for-alls, so feel free to bring your own setup if you wish to play more traditional 1v1s or other fighting games.

As with every year, this club aims to frequently host tournaments and other special events. Tournaments end up being the highlight of the year, so whether you're serious about beating everyone or are a casual looking to have fun, it's recommended that you sign up!

Be sure to join the discord server as most of our announcements and updates can be found there. ","Throughout the school year, many students might find themselves overwhelmed by the workload or keeping up with extracurriculars. Super Stuy Bros aims to help students destress by creating a place where they can forget about school and have fun. This club's meetings are always hosted near the end of the school week, so it rarely conflicts with student's schedules. At the end of a long week, sometimes you just want to play video games with some of your friends. This club is the place to do that.

Not only that, but we hope Super Stuy Bros allows members to meet new people and create long-lasting friendships with other students who share similar interests as them. At times, it might be difficult to find other people who like the same things that you do, especially since everyone is focused on their academics. This club may provide some people the perfect environment to create new friends. 

For members of the community who simply wish to improve their skill in the game, this club might be able to help. Not only are tournaments a great way to test how much you've improved, but we also plan on providing lessons to members willing to listen. Although seemingly unrelated, learning how to improve is something you can apply to any new skill you might learn in the future. 



",discord.gg/Ap9sgMwcx5,"In terms of leadership positions, there is the President and then Vice-Presidents. The President is chosen the previous year, usually nominated by that year's graduating President/Vice-Presidents. If the nominee agrees to become the President of the club, they will then pick Vice-Presidents to help them lead the club. The members they choose should be people that deserve the position and are trustworthy. Vice-Presidents should not be appointed just because they are close friends with the President. This year, the club is led through a shared leadership with multiple members sharing the role as President. 

If it is necessary to remove a leader due to any circumstances, their role will likely be given to another qualified member. If for any reason, a leader is showing irresponsible behavior, the other Presidents/Vice-Presidents will discuss a reasonable course of action. The current President/Vice-Presidents have always been seniors, so the transfer of leadership was more straightforward. However, if the current leaders are not graduating in that year, they should pass on the leadership to someone else unless club members unanimously agree that they should keep their positions next year. ","There are very few other clubs that demonstrate a focus on Super Smash Brothers or even fighting games as a whole. Super Stuy Bros will likely be the only club that can provide a place for all students interested in fighting games to gather. When compared to other genres of competitive video games, Smash and other fighting games tend to be very niche, especially when you compare them to games like League of Legends or CSGO. Not only will Super Stuy Bros attract the few students who show an interest in fighting games, but we hope it will also introduce the appeal of said games to more people.","Meetings are scheduled every week on Friday unless external circumstances prevent us from meeting.

Although Stuy Go Club is low commitment, players are able to play and interact with each other online outside of club meetings, where they can improve and discover new strategies. To participate, the only requirements are respect for fellow players and a willingness to learn. Above all else, Stuy Go Club serves as an environment in which students can relax while engaging in this millennia-old mind sport.","""Through Stuy Go Club, students will learn how to play the game that Chess Grandmaster Edward Lasker calls, """"so elegant, organic and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe they almost certainly play [it].""""

Throughout their journey of mastering Go, members will develop their critical thinking, foresight, pattern recognition, and patience, skills of great importance both in the game and in real life. One such application of these skills is in “reading”, or the act of predicting the possible moves your opponent can make, in response to your move(s), which allows you to determine the efficacy of such moves and develop a strategy. In short, reading utilizes critical thinking to analyze the board state, foresight to predict consequences of potential moves, pattern recognition to reach a decision faster, and patience to comb through the responses that an opponent can make.
One of the many fundamental practices of go players is called the “teaching ladder”, where more experienced players teach less experienced players through instruction or by playing games with them. Through the teaching ladder, everyone comes away learning something new. Stuy Go Club hopes to provide a recreational space where Go enthusiasts, casual players, and newcomers alike can end the day playing an engaging board game.""",https://discord.com/invite/evKSZZSWzU,"Leadership roles in Stuy Go Club consist of a President and a Vice President. The following year's President may be selected by the current President.
The Vice President is appointed by the President. All leaders must demonstrate proper understanding of the game and sufficient Go ability such that they are able to bring new members up to speed with the rules and efficient tactics. All leaders are expected to participate in at least 3 meetings per month, save for any excused absences.
Members are expected to respect other members and avoid abusive behavior. In extenuating circumstances, a member may be banned from the club following an unanimous decision by the leaders.
All members have the right to motion for an impeachment of a leader for any of the following: abusive behavior, misconduct, or a clear lack of dedication or ability. The motion to impeach a leader must be agreed upon by a 2/3 majority of members who have participated in Stuy Go Club for at least 2 months. The impeached may remain as a participating member of the club unless specified in the impeachment motion. Following an impeachment, leaders are promoted to the next highest position if possible. ","Stuy Go Club seeks to provide an inclusive community for Go players at Stuyvesant High School. Members will be able to participate in tournaments and competitions to obtain an internationally recognized rank, or just play casual games with other members. Go stands out among the board game crowd with its deceptively simple rules, but takes great lengths to master. Stuy Go Club serves as a platform for aspiring players to accelerate their journey in learning Go.","Once every week, although the day of the week may be changed to accommodate the schedules of Stuy Go Club's members.","['tuesday', 'thursday', 'wednesday']",low,"['boardgame', 'baduk', 'game']",,"Joshua Hsing Lung Wong - President

We aim to address any stereotypes and stigmas around the Hispanic and Black community while also answering any questions members may have. We encourage others to respect one another and uplift each other. Every member has the right to voice their own opinions and feelings during our meetings since it is a safe space. Members may also collaborate with leadership and give input on what topic they would like to discuss for future meetings. ASPIRA/BSL makes an effort to make our Hispanic and Black peers feel like they are at home and are comfortable at Stuyvesant. Using initiatives such as monthly TCARs, meetings with students from other schools, celebrating heritage months, and social media campaigns, the league and ASPIRA spread awareness among Black/Latinx and non-Black/Latinx students both inside and outside of Stuyvesant. Ultimately, the Black Student’s League and ASPIRA serve as student-run vehicles to improve the Black and Latinx experience at Stuyvesant","The Black Students League serves as a community of Black and Hispanic students at Stuyvesant and those who want to support the Black and Hispanic community. A small percentage of Stuyvesant students are Black/Hispanic, and it is important to have a space for social and cultural interaction between them. BSL and ASPIRA also discuss important issues facing their communities and offers education around these issues. Some of these issues are not talked about during school, so our clubs bring awareness to them. The Stuyvesant community is welcome to join the club meetings or learn about our mission through monthly TCARs, and Talk Circle Around Race events, where all students can come to discuss current and relevant topics concerning race. BSL and ASPIRA spread general information around Stuy’s community, addressing common stereotypes and stigmas, and celebrating Black and Hispanic History Month by helping people to become aware of important landmarks or figures in Black and Latinx history. Joining ASPIRA/BSL is an excellent way to discuss current events and important issues, as well as celebrate and learn about our culture. We also like to have a lot of fun and it is a great way to destress after school.

Members should make other students feel at home—not only within club meetings but also outside of club meetings during their classes and other extracurriculars. During club meetings, students should be respectful of the ideas, backgrounds, and identities of those around them. They must give people time to share their thoughts and be an active listener to those talking. Faculty members typically attend our meetings and share their thoughts as well as advise us from an adult point of view. Members should be attentive to the needs of fellow students and proactive in addressing them. If a member of the board is not doing their job properly or isn't respectful of others, club members can talk to the leaders and request that they be removed from their position.","The Black Students League and the Stuyvesant’s Hispanic Students Association are unique cultural clubs that emphasize and focus on Black and Hispanic voices alongside important matters within the community.

There are two teams of 4 players each, and each game is composed of 20 tossup-bonus cycles. Each tossup has a specific answer, and gives clues for that answer, starting with highly specific clues, and progressing towards more general and commonly known clues. The team who answers the tossup first then receives a bonus which is composed of three questions all relating to the same topic.

Members aren't required to come to every meeting, but are encouraged to do so when possible. Priority in tournaments and other events will be given to those with a consistent attendance to the club; however those are not required of any club member. Meetings will be composed of reading practice questions as well as preparing members for future questions. Studying between meetings is not mandatory, and those who only wish to play casually will not have to do so under any circumstances. ""","Quiz Bowl allows students can expose students to a wide range of topics including science, history, literature, fine arts, math, religion, mythology, and current events. Members of the club can gain a deeper knowledge of each subject in a fun, fast-paced, and motivating format in both a casual and competitive environment. Students also gain experience in communication and teamwork as each bonus often requires cooperation in order to get the answer. Members are not only able to learn with each other about the world around them, but also connect with each other by being able to understand each members strengths and weaknesses (teams may find a member who demonstrates additional proficiency in one of Quiz Bowl topics), as well as interact with students across the country in Quiz Bowl tournaments. Additionally, students can develop quick thinking and reaction skills as a result of having to identify and recall information in the fast-paced nature of the tossups.

Stuy Coalition Z,stuycoalitionz,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuycoalitionz/2f7225f9,Coalition Z informs students of the current political stances of the nation and provides them with opportunities to be more connected to activism. ,"Coalition Z is a national and youth-led organization that centers the voices of Generation Z in political conversations by bridging the gap between youth and their elected officials. Since 2016, it has harnessed Generation Z’s eagerness to enact change and connected it with concrete action. Members of Generation Z are the future voters of this country, and Coalition Z allows their voices to be heard. The organization follows 5 main goals: supporting legislation that focuses on issues that impact this generation, electing progressive candidates at all levels of government, connecting young people with their representatives, representing Generation Z’s values to shape legislation with elected officials, and informing this generation on the policies that affect them and their future. There are currently multiple chapters in schools throughout the country. Club members are given the opportunity to participate in political events, which have included lobbying, meeting their local representatives, and attending wide-spread meetings in the past. ","Stuyvesant is home to over 3,000 students, all in their teenage years. In less than 5 years most of them will be able to vote. Coalition Z helps students become more informed in their democracy and voting rights, and allows them to participate in it and gain experience before they can even officially vote. This nation, like any successful one, is struck with many issues, issues that will still need to be dealt with once these students are adults. They are the future of this country and they are the ones that will be dealing with the decisions and laws, being put into place right now, in merely five years or less. An educational environment calls for educational programs and this is nonetheless one of them. The past few years have seen political movements founded by the kids of Generation Z whether it be the students involved in the Parkland shooting or the global climate strike led by Greta Thunberg. Coalition Z is simply a continuation of the work of the notable leaders of Generation Z and a part of a movement that holds people in power accountable in all levels of government. Coalition Z serves to rid Stuy of the prevalent political apathy by engaging its students.",http://www.coalitionz.org/,"The current President and Vice President will hold those positions until the end of the first term of the President's senior year. If the Vice President is not a senior, they will become President and pick their new Vice President. If the Vice President is a senior, remaining members of the club will be eligible to run if approved by the graduating President and Vice president, which will be based on commitment and character. Elections will be held to determine new leadership. Members are expected to show up to at least four meetings a year and those holding leadership positions are expected to be responsive and communicative. If extra assistance is ever needed by the club leaders, applications for board positions will be sent out. Board positions include but are not limited to: supervision of social media, outreach, policy, and recruitment. Applicants will be interviewed and selected. For membership, everyone is free to join.

Regarding impeachment protocols, an executive/club member must find an executive member guilty of an inappropriate, improper, or negligent action (ex: bullying, harassment, discrimination, long-term inactivity, etc.) and collect 15 signatures from active club members to initiate an impeachment hearing with the Student Union. The executive board and Student Union members will vote on the removal of the executive member, and a majority must be reached to do so. Further disciplinary action will be taken if necessary; the remaining executive may choose to replace the executive removed or eliminate the position. ","Coalition Z is unique to Stuyvesant because there is currently no charter of an organization on such a large scale to the idea of youth politics and taking action on it. Stuyvesant is home to a lot of discourse, but Coalition Z actually takes meaningful debate out into the real world. Coalition Z takes action on it so that Generation Z's voices can be heard and so that they can lobby the legislators that decide their future. 
","Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, based on the frequency of events held, but we meet at least 4 times a month.

Stuy Study Society,sss,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/sss/43f673aa,"Our mission is to provide the opportunity for academic support to schools in underserved communities and promote better learning environments.
","The primary purpose of the Stuyvesant Study Society is to provide quality tutoring to a diverse demographic of underserved students residing in New York City’s five main boroughs. We want to get our tutors in connection with nonprofits and schools across the city so that they can make a difference for students in elementary, middle, and high school. We want our tutors to help close the glaring education gap that exists city-wide. Although we recognize that this problem is bigger than we are, we feel that as Stuyvesant students who have been exposed to limitless opportunities and exceptional education, we want to pay it forward by sharing the opportunities that we have to those who might not otherwise have access to them. Much of our role in the process would be as a facilitator: we connect our tutors with the tutoring organizations and schools we work with, making sure that they know where and when their sessions are, matching their schedules with available tutoring slots, and ensuring that the sessions themselves continue smoothly. By connecting as many students as possible with tutoring opportunities, we will be providing organizations with intelligent, hard-working tutors eager to make a difference.
","The Stuyvesant Study Society allows Stuyvesant’s scholars to interact with the community, make an impact in the city, and meet others just like them in the process. We enable tutors to reach out to communities that they have never been exposed to. They will be brought out of their Stuyvesant bubble and meet students who may not have the same backgrounds as them, nor have grown up in the same environment. They will be exposed to a variety of cultures through tutees and the neighborhoods that they travel to. In addition to experiencing a bright new environment, our tutors will also be part of an extremely rewarding experience: that being helping underserved students reach their goals. On the more practical side of things, tutors will develop their teaching skills, communication skills, and learn how to manage a weekly schedule with their tutees, as well receive community service hours. And through their organization, they will be provided with an opportunity to get a letter of certification at the end to prove their hard work. Not only will these benefits impact Stuy kids as individuals, but also will build relationships between Stuyvesant and the organizations that we work with, further expanding our network and allowing more scholars to join and reap the benefits of being a Stuyvesant Study Society tutor.
",,"Appointments to the board will be made through written applications and interviews. The board will consist of members conditional upon the needs of the club in a specific year. This will be determined by the assigned executive board.

Impeachment Protocols: The Executive Board may vote on the removal of co-presidents, or any Executive Board Member, of the Stuyvesant Study Society. Removal results in a loss of title and membership from the Stuyvesant Study Society. The Executive Board may vote to allow the impeached person membership of Stuyvesant Study Society, but can not hold a position on the Executive Board thereafter.
Motion for Impeachment
If a motion for Impeachment is to be called against a Board Member, they must clearly be failing to uphold the values of the Stuyvesant Study Society.
This would include (but is not limited to) failure to show up to meetings, an obvious lack of dedication to their duties as a Board Member, or a consistent inability to complete tasks that are necessary to the overall function of Stuyvesant Study Society.
If a Board Member believes that an Impeachment is necessary, they must motion to hold an Impeachment Hearing.
This motion must be seconded by at least two other Board Members, and if this occurs the Board will move forward to the Impeachment Hearing proceedings, detailed below.
Impeachment Hearing
An impeachment hearing is a formal discussion preceding the removal of a Stuyvesant Study Society executive
that all Board members must attend.
At the Impeachment Hearing, any member of the Executive Board may present reasons for the removal. Following this discussion, the Board Member being questioned will be allowed time to defend him/herself.
At that point, any member of the Committee may make a motion to remove the Board Member from office or close the hearing.
If no motion is made, then discussion will continue until such a motion is made.
If a motion is made to close the hearing, it must be seconded in order to vote to close. If it is seconded, then a simple majority vote will close the hearing, and the Board Member will keep their position.
If a motion for removal is made and seconded, a 2/3 majority must vote in favor in order to remove the Stuyvesant Study Society Board Member.
","SSS is unique in that we specifically partner with elementary schools and after school programs that have a significant portion of economically disadvantaged or homeless students.
Many Stuyvesant students come from low-income households, and we acknowledge our privilege to have access to an exceptional education. We believe we have an obligation to give back to the broader NYC community and are committed to bridging the education gap that exists city-wide. Our tutors have the rare opportunity to mentor and equip elementary school students with the tools and skills to succeed in higher education and beyond through personalized one-on-one sessions.","Our meeting schedule varies as we mainly communicate through email and each individual tutor makes their own meeting plans with their tutees. Normally tutors volunteer for one to two tutoring sessions a week. Tutoring sessions are held online through zoom.

Stuy Improv,improv,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/improv/90c8e331,"
Stuyvesant Improv is a safe, non-competitive space for students to express themselves and unlock their creativity, all while laughing and having fun.","Improv club is here to teach students the basics of theatre improv with a professional teacher and to allow them to unwind after the rigorous school day. Improv teaches students more than just routines and games, but how to think on their feet, think outside the box, openly collaborate with others, and adapt to new environments. During meetings an improv teacher initially leads the group through theatre games, some familiar from elementary school and some new, in order to warm members up and give them the chance to adjust to using gibberish, expressing ideas with their body, and responding quickly without filtering or doubting themselves. These games often also prompt students to initiate interactions by themselves, which makes students more comfortable with one another and new people in general. In other contexts, the actions in these games would be considered embarrassing, so this introduction also serves to lighten up participants and get everyone on equal footing. 
In the second half of the meeting, and this portion may increase as the season progresses, scene work becomes the main focus. Scenes usually only need two people but there might be more, all other members can observe as audience members. Audience members suggest the premise, learn from their peers, and get to enjoy an often hilarious performance. In the scenes, students will heighten their emotion and hone their storytelling skills by reacting to each other naturally within the constraints of the specific game/activity. Scenes will rotate so everyone has the opportunity to perform at some point. Throughout the meeting, members get feedback from their peers and the teacher. 
In-person meeting reminders will be relayed by the faculty advisor and other questions or communication can go to the emails of the leaders, the club email, or the Messenger group chat.","We provide students with an opportunity to be creative with their bodies and language and to practice thinking on the spot. A free improv class is a fun way for kids to set aside the constraints and stress of the school day and feel confident in expressing themselves among their peers. Improv also improves kids’ ability to generate new ideas and get out of their heads. Plus, it provides a community environment free of judgement, where the point is even sometimes to make a fool of oneself, which helps kids become more confident and helps build friendships that otherwise might have been inhibited by hesitance. 
Many in the Stuy community face the issues of intense academic duress, a lack of confidence, or an aversion to putting themselves out there. Through improv activities one cannot help but put themselves out there. Additionally, when one is told to clear their head and just say the first thing that comes to mind, there is no time to worry about the demands of teachers and schedules. It is imperative that Stuyvesant have a club where people can come to embarrass themselves, however counterintuitive that sounds, so they can learn not to fear whatever embarrassments may come their way in daily life. It is also a profoundly social club, there is just about no activity that could be classified as independent. Stuy students spend plenty of time, especially during remote learning, working alone, even by dividing group projects and completing their section with no thought given to how the project will come together. Independent work is an important skill this school teaches, but in improv activities, students must rely on each other and listen to each other’s input to create anything. Those skills will be useful in future business interactions just as much as they will be in social ones.",,"Improv is largely community-based, with all members having the same chances to participate, so leadership is mainly reserved for organizational purposes. As of yet, leaders are the most senior members of the club due its size. In the future, leaders will be nominated by the departing leader to the faculty advisor, and if there is an agreement, then the club member will be asked if they are interested in a leadership position. If they are not, someone else will be asked. The onus is on the outgoing leadership to choose their replacements as the most enthusiastic members who will be most dedicated to continuing the club, there is very little opportunity to abuse the little authority they have. 
If members do have a complaint about leadership they can email our faculty advisor or the other leader and ask that there be a change. If inappropriate behavior or incompetency is discovered then the other leader and the faculty advisor will agree on a new nominee and go through the procedure described above. If a member is interested in a leadership position they can email either current leader and ask to be nominated. If a leader wants to step down a new leader will be appointed but the leader will be expected to hold their position until the current meeting season ends.","Each day's workshop will have two components: theater games that are designed to loosen up the students and turn their focus onto interacting with the group as a whole; and then structured scenes where students play out improvised scenarios in front of the group while receiving expert coaching. The exercises are designed to encourage trust, teamwork, and risk-taking. Learning to accept failure and move on is encouraged, as is stretching emotional, physical, and verbal “comfort zones.” The workshop will also give the students a chance to see their peers from a different perspective, and to meet students they might not encounter during their academic day.
Improv was done for the first time at Stuy in the Spring of 2019; besides that, it has never been held as an extracurricular. Improv is a much lower-commitment, more spontaneity-focused extracurricular than acting, that focuses on developing acting skills in a different way: through improvisation, which improves quick-thinking and gets people out of their heads. It’s also wholly uncompetitive because there are no auditions, no experience required at all, and everyone wants to see everyone else do well; appreciating other members’ funny or well-done scenes. No one is ever ranked, and even scenes and games are contributed to by everyone present, through scene prompts. Thus, Improv is the only non-competitive, stress-free acting club that theater kids (and just kids who have a casual interest) can join and go into knowing that everyone will be viewed equally and have equal opportunity to participate in all activities.","We meet once a week for 8 mostly-consecutive weeks in Autumn, and then again in the Spring.

Today, a good-paying job and salary are not enough to guarantee financial security, which is the priority for many. We know that everyone, from those just trying to help out their families financially to those who want to pursue the economics/finance field, will greatly benefit from learning about passive income, the stock market, investment returns, retirement planning, and more. Stuynomics will guide students in navigating the complexities of economics by providing a structured path of learning during our weekly meetings. While the leaders of Stuynomics bring to the table their prior knowledge, they also join their colleagues on the journey to financial literacy. Stuynomics will instill within members the fundamentals of economics (terminology, techniques, trends, etc), before moving onto more advanced material. Members will also get the chance to apply their learning hands-on through a variety of activities such as games, stock market simulations, and competitions. In addition, another main goal of the organization is to bring greater clarity to the ideas of stocks and economic trends, which may be an intimidating and alien concept to many. Through the use of a variety of games as well as student led lessons, we aim to fix this issue. With this, our ultimate goal is for our members of varying experience levels to be able to pave a financially secure future for themselves and their families.","We want to help our members become more responsible adults who understand how to manage their income and make smart financial decisions.

Finance and financial markets are only a small part of what economics encompasses. Economics can vary from fundamental topics like homeownership or the inner workings of taxes. However, economics also encompasses many complex topics, such as the depths of supply and demand and how it affects global companies (e.g. Amazon), and the different economic systems that are utilized around the world and in history. Our goal is to represent the nuances in economics and show how interconnected the field is.

Stuyvesant UNICEF,stuyunicef,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyunicef/d041edda,"Pursue a more equitable world for every child through advocacy, education, community building, and fundraising.","UNICEF UNITE Clubs are on the front lines of youth-led change to advocate for the rights of the world's most vulnerable children. Stuyvesant UNICEF empowers students to become global citizens. Through fundraising, awareness, and community service, Stuyvesant UNICEF contributes to aiding the millions of children who need help. Stuyvesant UNICEF is part of a diverse community of UNICEF supporters who are passionate about advancing the survival, protection and development of children everywhere. Students will develop leadership skills to make an impact by participating in training with UNICEF USA staff. They will also get to build relationships with student leaders around the country and gain a deeper understanding of UNICEF’s programs and how they make a difference for children. 

Each Stuyvesant UNICEF activity falls into one of the following categories: 
Advocacy: Members of Stuyvesant UNICEF use their voice for youth around the globe by staying civically engaged on a federal, state and local level. Members take legislative action online and during key moments throughout the year to push for funding and policies for children. 
Education: Stuyvesant UNICEF spreads awareness about the challenges children face around the world.
Community Building: Stuyvesant UNICEF builds partnerships with local organizations. Members volunteer in the community to help ensure that every child is safe, healthy and has access to a quality education. Stuyvesant UNICEF coordinates its efforts with other UNICEF high school and college clubs to promote the well-being of children in the NYC community and beyond.
Fundraising: Stuyvesant UNICEF plans and hosts fundraising events that raise money for UNICEF. These fundraisers are held in support of children’s survival, access to safe water, nutrition, health care, and protection from violence, exploitation and abuse.","Stuyvesant UNICEF serves as a space to discuss global issues and concerns. Students have the opportunity to brainstorm unique methods to provide aid to the world’s most vulnerable children while gaining a valuable understanding of how to take initiative. Discussing global issues leaves the members with a better understanding of current events and a widened view of the world around them. Stuyvesant UNICEF covers a wide range of UNICEF’s Program Areas, such as child protection, education, and water access. These may align with certain areas of study in history/social studies classes, allowing for a more insightful, understanding inside and outside of the classroom. Stuyvesant UNICEF brings a 70 year old organization, shaping the global development agenda into the school community. The club will also provide students with an opportunity to gain leadership positions that will help them improve their public speaking, conflict-resolution skills, and communication skills. Stuyvesant UNICEF holds events that strengthen the Stuyvesant community and are great ways to meet new people. Through connections with other schools and organizations, students will be able to meet UNICEF UNITERs outside of the Stuyvesant community. UNICEF will help students realize that they have a voice and that they have the ability to come up with their own ideas of how to help children all around the world. ",,"Leaders of Stuyvesant UNICEF are united by a common desire to make a difference both locally and globally. Leaders engage with their classmates, community, and local organizations to become champions for children. There are six leadership positions in Stuyvesant UNICEF: President, Vice President, Treasurer, Publicist, Event Coordinator, and Secretary. There are also 5 chair positions that lead the committees during each meeting: Advocacy Chair, Community Building Chair, Recruitment Chair, Fundraising Chair, and Education Chair. Prospective leaders and chairs will fill out a written application and some will be chosen to be interviewed by the current board of leaders and chairs. The qualifications for becoming a Stuyvesant UNICEF leader/chair include attending over 50% of meetings and events, a GPA of 85 or higher, having strong leadership skills, and being familiar with UNICEF’s programs and campaigns. The chosen incoming leaders/chairs will shadow the current board for a few weeks. After, incoming leaders will host a club meeting on their own and the incoming chairs will host a committee meeting. They will receive notes from the current board on where they succeeded and what they can improve upon. If the prospective leader or chair did not show leadership potential, they will have a second chance to lead before the position is withdrawn. Incoming leaders/chairs will meet with the current board to discuss the club’s accomplishments and help them plan for the following year. Together they will identify challenges and pending issues, as well as promising projects and ideas that should be further developed. If a member of the board fails to execute their responsibilities, they will receive a warning. In the case that they do not fix their behavior, the remaining leaders will vote to decide if the board member should be impeached. If all leaders vote in favor of impeachment, the board member will be removed from their position as leader or chair and a replacement will be selected by the remaining leaders. ","Stuyvesant UNICEF is part of the UNICEF UNITE Clubs program, a youth-led grassroots organization. As members, students are able to use their voice to advocate for children across the globe. UNICEF was founded in 1946 to assist children who were affected by World War II. Now UNICEF works in more than 190 countries and has helped save more young lives than any other humanitarian organization. Members of Stuyvesant UNICEF get to be part of this incredible history. Members of Stuyvesant UNICEF will have the opportunity to be part one of the five committees: Fundraising, Advocacy, Education, Community Building, or Recruitment. UNICEF USA gives out special awards to clubs that go above and beyond the yearly requirements. In addition, Stuyvesant UNICEF gives out its own awards and prizes for members who show dedication to the club. Members of Stuyvesant UNICEF have the opportunity to speak up for children and share their voice with legislators through the UNICEF USA Action Center.

Stuy Criminal Psychology,stuycriminalpsychology,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuycriminalpsychology/da73414b,"Stuy Criminal Psychology is devoted to giving students who enjoy criminal psychology and/or true crime a place to indulge in their passions.
","Stuyvesant Criminal Psychology is meant to give students who have a passion for psychology and/or true crime, a place to grow their knowledge and feel at home. Each week our club hosts 2 meetings where we dive into the minds of criminals and use psychology to evaluate and agree or disagree with different already decided or cold cases. To learn how to understand these criminals, we will be watching different educational documentaries that provide a summary of the killer's actions and then offer up our own opinions of the case while determining why the killer committed the crime. Stuy Criminal Psychology gives students opportunities to do hands-on activities that stimulate the brain and test out their theories in situations. Although there are many branches of psychology, using psychology to analyze criminals is very important for getting justice for victims and we at Stuy Criminal Psychology hope that we can create new leaders in the field of criminal psychology.","Stuy Criminal Psychology can offer students in the Stuyvesant community an opportunity to learn about the field of criminal psychology. Members of the club will gain unique opportunities to enhance their understanding of various criminal psychology topics and be given opportunities for different criminal psychology internships. Students will also be able to expand their length of extracurriculars for college apps with the many open leadership positions and the expanse of opportunities. We also hope to partner up with different teachers to offer extra credit or different projects to our club members. After each meeting, an email will be sent out to people who missed the meeting to make sure they can still stay involved. With those emails, once a week an email will be sent out either with new interesting cases, links for presentations being given by criminal psychologists, internship opportunities, volunteering opportunities, and other projects involving criminal psychology, CSI, or true crime so we can satisfy all our member's unique passions. Additionally, another email will be sent out once a month with different book recommendations or movie recommendations that we can touch on during the meetings but mainly just to provide other interesting stories that members can learn and continue learning outside of the club room itself. In conclusion, Stuy Criminal Psychology has something for everyone and many students can find themselves busy and enjoying the time they have while participating along with all the academic benefits it has.
",@stuycriminalpsychology,"Currently, we have 5 leadership positions available such as social media coordinator, outreach, etc…Forms will be sent out for each position where club members can apply and we will look into all the applicants and choose which member is perfect for the job. After the leaders are chosen, they will be given time to understand their responsibilities (ex: how to organize events, how to format the social media, etc... and come up with their own ideas on how to manage the club. When one graduate, their spot will be open, and google forms will be resent out. If someone in a leadership position is not doing their job and not adding anything insightful or helpful to the club, they will be removed and stripped of their leadership position. This applies to all positions. If there are any other issues like arguments within the club, a meeting will be held and solutions will be discussed with both members and leaders.
","Stuy Criminal psychology is unique because it is one of the few clubs that bring two to three concepts together. Stuy Criminal psychology is a combination of both true crime, and psychology and even includes ideas of legal processes. By joining Stuy Criminal Psychology, students who enjoy true crime podcasts can come and talk about how they feel when they hear a new case, and students who have a passion for psychology can join to learn more about that specific very important branch of psychology. Although there already is a psychology club, Stuy Criminal Psychology focuses on one specific branch of psychology, and students who want to pursue a career in criminal psychology can delve deeper and expand their knowledge in their future careers.
","Our meeting schedule will vary from week to week but the set meeting days would be Tuesday and Friday.

Stuy Psalms,stuypsalms,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuypsalms/8578300e,Stuy Psalms allows students who embraces Jewish or Christian worship music in the language of Hebrew to learn and perform Hebrew worship songs.,"Stuy Psalms aims to provide a safe environment for Stuyvesant students who have a passion for Hebrew religious music of Judaism, Christianity, and/or Messianic Judaism belief. Members will learn Hebrew worship songs and perform them through singing and instruments. No experience with singing, instruments, or the language of Hebrew is needed to join the club. There is also no religious requirement. Anyone who has a love for Hebrew worship music may join regardless of their background. For meetings, workshops will be held to teach Hebrew worship songs. Throughout the year, there will also be many worship sessions where members will present what they have learned as a team. This club also offer members the opportunity to cover songs on their own and uploading recorded videos to online platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, and performing at school events such as the SOS (Stuyvesant Open Showcase). This club is medium-commitment. Ususally, meetings will be held once a week. However, the number of meetinsg may increase when there is an upcoming performance for the sake of practice.","Stuy Psalms will benefit Stuyvesant by helping to reduce the sentiment of antisemitism and Christiphobia in our school community by introducing students to Jewish and Christian culture as they learn Hebrew worship songs of these beliefs. Currently, in our society, negative sentiment towards the Jewish and Christian communities are becoming norms due to various factors. Stuy Psalms hopes to help students who belong to these communities to find pride in their identity, build a bridge between them and non-Jewish/Christian students inside Stuyvesant through Hebrew music, and increase the solidarity of the Stuyvesant community. While Hebrew is not offered as one of the foreign language courses at Stuyvesant, Stuy Psalms gives interested students an opportunity to come into contact with this language when they learn Hebrew songs in this club. Sometimes, Stuy Psalms will also introduce Jewish historical or cultural knowledge related to the Hebrew songs being taught during workshops, which will help members who identifies as Jewish to connect to their heritage, and push non-Jewish students to step out of their comfort zone to learn new knowledge about Jewish culture and history. Since Stuy Psalms welcomes everyone inside of the Stuyvesant community to join regardless of neither their experience with Hebrew or musical skill, Stuy Psalms provides members the experience to perform music as a group using vocal and different musical instruments like a band, which is an opportunity many students may not usually have. ",,"The current President and Vice President have already been decided for their outstanding capability as leaders. The President may appoint a board member to be Co-Presidents with. There may be more than one Vice President. When the President graduate, the Vice President or Vice Presidents will automatically become the new President or Co-Presidents. New board members may be chosen by sending out an application form. The President and the Vice President will carefully examine all applications received and select the objectively most outstanding applicants as new leaders. The President and the Vice President may also appoint club members who demonstrates remarkable ability and great potential to be leaders. All leaders are required to dedicate their best to the club. If a leader is absent to too many meetings, produces or supports hate speech, uses violence against another person, or makes any other action that is considered inappropriate in the school, the board will hold a poll and vote to decide whether the leader will be impeached or not. If the leader is impeached and was the President before the impeachment, the Vice President will automatically become the new President. If any other leader are impeached, the President may appoint new leaders.","Although there are many other clubs dedicated to music and religion at Stuyvesant, there is no other extracurricular activity at Stuyvesant that involves the use of the language of Hebrew, or one that brings together students with Jewish and Christian identity, and also recognizes the importance of the Messianic Jewish community. This is also the only club that specializes in Jewish and Christian religious music. Since musical worship is a very significant component in both Judaism and Christianity, Stuy Psalms gives students who share the same religious belief a place to freely express their faith through music.","Our club plans to hold one meeting every week, which adds up to four meetings a month. The day of the week we will meet on will be decided later based on the availability of members.

Stuy Burmese Association,burmeseassociation,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/burmeseassociation/266ff12c,The Burmese Association's mission is to spread Burmese culture throughout Stuyvesant High School,"This association was created to bring all the Burmese of Stuy together as well as educate anybody curious about Myanmar's culture. This club will plan events and fundraisers inspired by traditional Burmese holidays and sell traditional Burmese food throughout the entire year. The members of this club will also volunteer in other Burmese traditional events if the club cannot find the time to organize its own. The club will also collaborate with other cultural clubs due to the vast religious and ethnic diversity of the country. This club will also take everyone so long as they are willing to help out in planning the association's events and are genuinely interested in Burmese culture. In general, the members of the club will be expected to attend most meetings and significantly help out in any events that are planned. All members will be vetted personally by the leaders to ensure that each member will be very convicted in the running of this association.","This Association will bring together the normally scattered Burmese students at Stuy, who are almost never found out as Burmese unless specifically asked. It will also spread a very underrepresented culture all throughout Stuy through events and fundraisers. It also provides students the opportunity to participate and volunteer in rather unknown cultural events. It also provides US-born Burmese students to experience genuine Burmese culture and embrace their cultural background and be around said people without fear of being ""the odd one out"". In addition, it provides a place for the immigrated Burmese kids of Stuy to come together and reflect on their shared cultural experiences. It also helps non-Burmese people to better understand Burmese culture and experience its delicious food. On the subject of food, the association is also a way for immigrated Burmese kids to enjoy the delicious food they once enjoyed in Burma thousands of miles away. This association could also bring together the Burmese parents of Stuyvesant, who are usually unknowing that there are other Burmese parents in the School. All in all, the club will establish a solid cultural identity for the Burmese students of Stuyvesant High School, bringing delicious food and fun cultural events along with it.",https://www.instagram.com/stuyburma/,"This club is very democratic. Every semester, there will be a voting period in which 2 new leaders will be elected. A ranked voting system will be utilized to maximize effectiveness of democratic decisions. After each voting round, the lowest candidate will be removed from the voting pool and these rounds will go on until two candidates are left. These two candidates will be the leaders of the club for the following semester. In order to impeach a leader, 2/3 of the members will have to agree to impeach said leader. Only then will another voting period start to elect a new leader. On the other hand, if a member is to be removed from the association, half of the entire association will have to agree to remove them along with both of the leaders. Either that or 3/4 of the association will have to agree to remove the member in question, at which point the leaders' approval is null and void.","The Stuy Burmese association is representative of a very underrepresented culture in Stuy. It is also unique in the fact that it donates its profits to an international civil war. This Association will not only benefit the cultural knowledge of the Stuy population as a whole; it also brings together the normally split-apart Burmese community of Stuyvesant High School. The club gives all Stuy students, be it Burmese or not, an opportunity to experience the unique culture of a normally-forgotten country in Southeast Asia.","Our meeting schedule will be pretty lax but the frequency may increase as big events start to roll around the corner.

Stuyvesant Key Club,stuykc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuykc/c0911c36,"Stuyvesant Key Club is centered around providing students with opportunities to serve their community, build character, and develop key skills. ","Key Club is an international student-led community service organization centered around community building and volunteering. This organization is dedicated to bettering their community by presenting members with the opportunity to volunteer at service projects across the city and state. Members have the opportunity to volunteer in-school as well, whether in collaboration with the Student Union, PTA, Administration or individual clubs and organizations. 

In addition to volunteering, Stuyvesant Key Club also plans and organizes numerous fundraisers for international charities such as Thirst Project, a non-profit organization known for providing clean water to areas where it is inaccessible, and UNICEF, a non-profit organization advocating for children’s rights and their health in over 190 countries. Beyond that, Stuyvesant Key Club also raises funds for causes meaningful to them such as the National Network of Abortion Funds and Black Artist Iniative. From fundraising for international charities to local causes, Key Clubbers help make a difference in the world and leave a lasting impact. 

Key Club is a club where members can form friendships and make connections not only in Stuy, but also with Key Clubbers all throughout the city, the state, the country, and even other parts of the world. General members are expected to volunteer at service projects, whether in school or out of school, and also attend club meetings throughout the school year. Members are also encouraged to attend and help out with fundraisers to help raise money for incredible causes. Overall, the level of commitment and dedication for Key Club is completely up to the members themselves, as they can choose which meetings and service projects they would like to attend. If members would like to take a bigger part, they can apply for leadership positions both in their home club and on a division/district level. ","Key Club is a valuable asset to the Stuyvesant community because it promotes leadership, character building, caring, and inclusiveness—our four core values. 

We offer numerous opportunities for members to take on a leadership role, including being a project captain who oversees volunteers at events, directing or serving on one of our four committees, being an executive cabinet member, or even leading the entire state on the New York District board. These leadership positions, whether big or small, help Key Clubbers to gain real skills that can not only help them in Key Club but also in Stuyvesant and in the real world. 

Key Club also provides its members with numerous opportunities around the globe. From networking with nonprofit leaders to earning internationally acclaimed scholarships and awards, these opportunities set up Key Clubbers for life beyond High School. 

Volunteering at Key Club events allows members to serve and give back to their communities. When volunteering, members often have the chance to meet Key Clubbers from other schools in New York City and even other parts of the world, forming new friendships and new connections which builds our members’ sense of community and teamwork. Even after graduating, Key Clubbers have the option of joining Circle K, which is essentially the college version of Key Club, and another branch of the Kiwanis family. Beyond Circle K, they can join Kiwanis, and continue making an impact on communities as an adult. By first joining Key Club, members can go on to become altruistic members of their community not only in high school but throughout their lives.",linktr.ee/stuykc,"The Executive Cabinet—composed of the President, the Vice President, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the Webmaster, and the Editor—is chosen by Key Club members through a democratic election that takes place in late January or early February. Members interested in having a position will first fill out an application and complete an interview to ensure their capability of serving in such a high-stake role. Afterwards, the candidates will present a short speech in front of those that attend the election meeting and those members will be voting for the candidate that they think will best serve the position out of all the candidates running for that position. Those who are running for a leadership position must be a dues-paying member of Key Club International so they can be registered with Key Club International after being elected. 

In terms of impeachment, five members of the Executive Cabinet (which is the entire cabinet except for the person being impeached) must agree that the current officer is not doing what is expected of them and should be impeached. Someone else will be either selected by the five remaining members of the Executive Cabinet or elected by the members at another meeting to fill the vacancy, depending on the situation. For the Board of Directors, the process to become a committee director is an application and an interview process. Applicants will be interviewed by members of the Executive Cabinet and committee directors will be selected after taking into consideration both the application and the interview. If a committee director is chosen but is not fulfilling their assigned responsibilities, they will be cut and a new director will be chosen by the Executive Cabinet.","What makes Key Club unique is how truly international of an organization it is. Members can volunteer at service projects and attend fundraisers with Key Clubbers outside of Stuyvesant, from schools like Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, and many more. Key Clubs are found in countless schools throughout the city, allowing members to serve their community with people they might already know from other schools and of course, see lots of new faces and make new friends. Key Clubs can also be found throughout the world, where members can meet Key Clubbers from all over, especially if you go for higher positions outside of Key Club. From the citywide Fall Rally to the statewide Leadership Training Conference, and even the Key Club International Convention, Key Club is also unique because of the conferences and conventions that are held in addition to service projects and fundraisers. These events allow Key Clubbers to learn new skills and establish connections with a wide variety of Key Clubbers, from other parts of New York State to other parts of the country. 

Even though to many, Key Club is just another community service organization, there is a lot more than just volunteering it has to offer. That includes fundraising for awesome causes, attending large-scale conventions, celebrating our yearly accomplishments at events through awards, and meeting people from all over the world who can become lifelong friends. Key Club is not just a club, but a way of life and a welcoming family anyone can turn to.
","Thursdays or Fridays - Stuyvesant Key Club meets twice a month, one meeting being a general meeting for updates and important events and the other being a service project!

Beyond that, divisionals with Key Clubbers across Manhattan and the Bronx are scheduled for once a month. Service Projects are typically scheduled for every weekend for the entirety of the year, however the amount you attend is completely up to you!

The Stuyvesant Indicator,stuyvesantindicator,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyvesantindicator/1dda8746,"The Indicator, Stuyvesant’s senior yearbook, intends to produce a special collection of memories for the graduating seniors.","The Stuyvesant Indicator aims to create a 300+ page yearbook for the graduating seniors. In doing so, Indicator staff (comprised of students across all four years) are able to explore their interests in any of our seven departments: Art, Copy, Layout, Photos, Circulation, Business, and Literary. General members are expected to complete assignments from the department(s) they choose to be in.
No experience is necessary to join any department! In fact, most staff members do not have experience in their respective departments prior to joining the team.
Members of the Indicator staff, many of whom start off as freshmen, learn a variety of skills—including digital design and layout, business management and pitching, photography, art, and writing. Indicator staff receive small assignments throughout the school year that allow them to develop these skills and interact with their school on a more intimate level, either in person or online. They reap the fruits of their work at the end of the year when the yearbook is printed.
Though considered a low-commitment club, members can easily become more involved! Most departments space out their assignments, but members may request additional assignments if they wish to be further involved in the process. The Indicator also invites all members to join multiple departments if desired. The process changes year by year, and all ideas and skills are valuable in producing an extraordinary yearbook.
","The Indicator provides an outlet for students to explore their creative and professional interests. It is also responsible for contributing to the senior class's experience during their last class of high school by planning, organizing, and photographing senior spirit days, hosting fundraisers and the seasonal flower sales in order to raise money and lower senior dues, and producing a beautiful 300-page hardcover book for the seniors to keep as a memento of their four years of high school.
Members of our business department are able to learn valuable skills in handling face-to-face interactions, advertising, pitching products, and keeping track of large sums of money. It is the work of the business department that allows the school and the Student Union to keep the price of senior dues as low as possible. The business team operates in conjunction with the circulation members, who are responsible for marketing and communications. 
Members of our other departments get the chance to interact with hundreds of students—upperclassmen in particular—to work on creative mini-projects for the yearbook, including page design, fine arts, photography, and writing. For example, artists build the backbone of the yearbook around each year’s unique theme. Original works from artists are featured as the cover, headers, dividers, and backgrounds. Photographers capture memories from student clubs, sports teams, spirit days, and more in order to preserve special moments for seniors to look back on. Likewise, those involved in writing and layout assist in small projects that come together to create a cohesive publication.
The Indicator as a whole serves as a physical imprint of each graduating class. Not only does it allow the graduating senior class to leave their personalized mark on their school, but non-senior staff members also gain valuable experience by contributing to a beautiful yearbook.
",https://sites.google.com/view/indicator2023/home,"Editors of each department and the new Editor-in-Chiefs are chosen in June of every school year. The current Editors-in-Chief release a written application, followed by an in-person interview. On average, each department is led by two or three editors, who are in charge of communicating with their department members directly.
Starting in 2018, the position of Editor-in-Training (EITs) for departments was created. While editors are typically rising seniors who have prior experience in their department, EITs are rising sophomores or juniors who take on the full responsibilities of editor while working under the guidance of their older editors, who train them throughout the school year to take their place with more confidence and experience.
Editors who do not fulfill their responsibilities will first be required to meet with the Editor-in-Chiefs to discuss their performance and methods of improvement. If the Editor-in-Chiefs do not see any improvement, they will go to Mr. Lonardo, the Indicator’s faculty advisor. With his permission, we will impeach the editor. Through a written form and interview, a new editor will have to be appointed if one is impeached.
","Though the yearbook is distributed exclusively to seniors, it offers underclassmen a unique opportunity to become involved more intimately with the senior traditions of the school. It also allows students who want to explore being part of a larger publication without the large time commitment to explore different aspects of business, art, digital design, and writing. Ultimately, Indicator staff are able to have a larger say in determining the artistic and creative vision of a keepsake that hundreds of students will cherish.
","Though there are few meetings for Indicator as a whole, departmental meetings are up to the respective department editors to coordinate. For select departments, teaching days will be hosted to familiarize staff members with certain skills. Members of the Indicator will also have the opportunity to meet one another and collaborate on assignments!

Caliper Magazine,calipermag,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/calipermag/15725b0b,"Since its conception in 1906, Caliper Literary Magazine has been a haven for Stuyvesant's artists and writers.","The purpose of Caliper Literary Magazine is twofold. First, the club holds weekly meetings for students to free-write, free-draw, or respond to one of the provided prompts, which can deal with elements of writing and art ranging from topic to structure to theme. Often, meetings will begin with prompt suggestions from members. After working for 30-45 minutes, members share their work with the group. On workshop days, the editors will lead the group in a series of designed activities to work on a specific skill of either writing or art. On peer-editing day, members may share any work they wish, even if they have not written it for Caliper, or even professional work that interests them. Members then give constructive feedback on the other members’ work, and suggest that other members do the same. The magazine is published physically twice a year. Throughout the year, chosen pieces by Caliper members will be periodically published to the Caliper website and/or instagram.","Caliper serves not only as a creative outlet through publication of the magazine, but also as a community of writers and artists that helps students to find their voice. In the midst of Stuyvesant's ultra-competitive environment, it is good to have a place to appreciate other students’ creativity, alongside one’s own. Caliper is welcoming to all students, yet maintains a close-knit feel between its members and facilitates creative growth through a supportive environment where they can hone their writing and storytelling skills, skills that extend to many parts of life. Members get practice in writing poems and short stories, drawing portraits and landscapes, which can prepare them for competitions and careers, while maintaining a relaxed environment. During meetings, the leaders provide the members with prompts to get their creative juices flowing and encourage them to share their creation. This allows members to find their creative voice in a way not consistently encouraged by other outlets. Distribution of the magazine showcases some of the creative talents of our students that are better expressed in print than in performances, and encourages other students to produce their own work, altogether contributing to Stuyvesant’s oldest literary tradition, connecting the students today to the students of more than one century ago.",@caliper.mag,"Caliper is a community-driven club, and so the editors-in-chief and members of the club are in constant communication, with the members trusting their editors to be transparent and explain everything related to the matters of this club. If there ever comes a point where an editor-in-chief of the club abuses their powers or neglects their duties as editor, it is upon both the other two editors-in-chief — as well as the members themselves — to recognize and address the issue. It is imperative that all the editors-in-chief contribute to the development, punctual, and engaged all — if not almost all — of the time.If the time arises that this promise is being undermined or ignored, the proper impeachment procedure will follow. Additionally, any form of disrespect or intolerance displayed by any members during or outside of meetings will not be tolerated. In appointing future editors when current ones graduate or are no longer able to lead, there will be a fair application process available to all that are interested involving a requirement of short responses demonstrating dedication as well as a lengthy interview process. Potential candidates will be interviewed and assessed by the current editors-in-chief who will design a Google Forms and schedule a Google Meets (for the interview) in order to decide the new editors-in-chief.","Caliper is more than just a publication. It is a home for writers, for poets, for artists --- for everyone, really. It is a place for you to unleash your creativity when Stuyvesant can feel like an environment where creativity is stifled. It is somewhere where you can just be you, and be appreciated for it. At Caliper, you are able to interact with people who share similar interests, share your work, and get advice and feedback. At the end of the day, Caliper puts the unity in community (and yes, we know how cheesy that sounds).","We meet on a weekly basis, on the day most suitable for the majority of our members.

We will go over techniques and the science behind how our brains learn information, and improve at various skills. We will cover subjects such as learning to memorize things easily, how to improve at talent based hobbies/subjects, dispel myths such as 10000 hours being needed to master any topic, what is truly required to become an expert at something, and the various modes of the brain and how we can use them to our advantage. Club members are expected to show up to the bimonthly meetings. While we recommend showing up to every meeting, we understand that life may sometimes get in the way. We will give an overview of all future meetings at our first meeting, so that club members will know what to expect, and which meetings they should prioritize going to depending on their needs. Additionally, we may add extra tutoring and consultation depending on student needs.
","The Stuyvesant community will benefit by learning how to more efficiently study for a subject, or improve at a hobby. This will improve the depth of their learning, and reduce the time spent required on doing so, so that they can spend the extra time doing something they'd enjoy. Additionally, if students are struggling with any subject or hobby, the techniques and information we offer at our club will allow them to surpass any plateau or difficulties they may run into. At Stuyvesant Highschool, the student mindset is often that you have to study long hours a day, and that without it you will not be able to succeed. This mindset is further romanticized by many aspects of media, such as Youtube videos trying to teach you how to study for long hours. However, not only can this mindset quickly become toxic, it can also lead to a detriment in performance, as there is only so much the human brain can take before it begins to burnout. Our goal is to improve not only the learning ability of Stuyvesant students, but also dispel the mindset that you must dedicate all of your time to something in order to see any returns.",Instagram: stuydy_,"Our leadership positions will consist of: President or Co-Presidents, Secretary, Programming Chair and a Membership Chair

The Presidents will be in charge of reviewing and selecting leadership applications and candidates, scheduling meetings, preparing meeting content, and making sure the club runs smoothly. The Secretary will be in charge of managing communications with other clubs, the SU/Club Pub Department, members (through the Membership Chair or directly), as well as making sure student materials are prepared before meetings. The Programming Chair will be in charge of managing technical aspects of the club, such as creating schedules/formatting lessons, and designing and creating a website that we may incorporate in the future. The Programming Chair will also be responsible for managing (but not necessarily creating content) content for our social media. The Membership Chair will be responsible for logging meetings and checking attendance, addressing student needs, questions and relaying them to the Presidents/Secretary, and managing recruitment/expansion of the club's member count. As for the possible impeachment of any of these leadership positions, if me and the other president, Orup, believe there is any reason to (such as insufficient contribution and commitment, actions with malicious intent towards the running of the club, or extremely poor performance), we will give one warning maximum, and if the issue is continued, then the member in question will be relieved of their leadership positions, contacting and notifying them of such, and we will release new applications for the position. ","While many other clubs are solely dedicated to one topic or hobby, the skills learned at our club are far more general, and can be used anywhere learning or skill-development is involved. We are also confident that our club's purpose is something that many students need, as bad study practices loom everywhere, even in a school like Stuyvesant. Our club will allow students to not only better their skills at the hobbies and subjects they care about or struggle with, but will clear up more time in their schedule so that they may do the things they love.","As of now, our meeting schedule will be twice a month, but this is subject to change.

The ACLU at Stuy partners directly with the national office of the ACLU and the local NYCLU to get resources for students to learn about and work with issues they care about most. Each month, the ACLU at Stuy chooses a different issue that it finds to be most pressing/important, and works with the ACLU and NYCLU to help them with their ongoing work with the issue, as well as to work on activism internally at Stuy, especially on issues surrounding education and schools. The organization also brings in speakers and coordinates events to educate the wider student body about ACLU’s work and the issues plaguing our communities. The ACLU at Stuy is a great opportunity for any student looking to become more politically informed and involved.","The ACLU at Stuy will benefit the Stuyvesant community by not only educating students about pressing issues in our country, but also by teaching students how to get involved and be politically active within their own communities. The ACLU at Stuy serves to educate students on how civil liberties are being impacted in our society and how they differ from state to state and country to country. Students will also be able to explore topics they care about most and find ways to engage with these issues, through modes of activism including phone banking, protesting, and email/letter writing. Protesting and other forms of activism are at the forefront of effectuating change, and exploring and participating in ways to help would be an important aspect of this club for students. The ACLU at Stuy is affiliated with the New York City affiliate of the ACLU (the NYCLU), as well as the ACLU’s national office. These connections allow students to learn more about happenings and opportunities for activism within their own communities, as well as the greater initiatives and work of the ACLU and its affiliates. Much of Stuyvesant’s student body is politically active and with some students being able to vote, learning about these defining topics of our generation will be instrumental in being an educated voter and providing tangible, meaningful change.",,"Two co-presidents (generally rising seniors) are appointed by the former co-presidents at the end of each year.

In the case of incompetence or widespread disapproval of one or both of the presidents, with the approval of the Faculty Advisor, a live vote may be held among the members, and a ¾ majority is required for impeachment. The other president may veto an impeachment, but the Faculty Advisor may overrule the veto with ¾ support from members.","This club is unique because Stuyvesant currently does not have an ACLU chapter, so the ACLU at Stuy specializes in the ACLU and NYCLU’s main issues, unlike other political clubs at Stuy.

Stuy Cheer,cheer,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/cheer/daaad4b3,Stuy Cheer wants to help raise school spirit and help develop a school environment that is supportive and excited about its other team sports.,"Stuyvesant Cheerleading serves to provide the school with a source of spirit and support for our sports teams. We work to build our school's spirit by cheering at football games and performing at pep rallies. In addition to cheering and crowd-leading, our team also performs stunts. We practice everything from basket tosses to spinning and flipping skills, keeping the audience awestruck and engaged. After football season we hope to continue cheering for basketball or other sports who need the enthusiasm. During pep rallies we showcase everything from our cheering and dancing abilities to our partner stunt and team pyramid skills. Every summer we perfect these skills at our annual four-day cheerleading camp where we won best overall team spirit four years running. We proudly brought home the top banana displayed in our very own gymnastics gym. Our team works hard together and pushes for each other. We are a tight knit family and we wouldn't have it any other way. 
	We practice throughout the summer and fall, with tryouts at the end of every school year. No experience is necessary and we are always looking for more members to turn into Stuy Cheerleaders! ","One thing we notice about Stuyvesant is the fact that there are multiple mascots- from the Peglegs to the Felines, and the Pirates to the Penguins. Because the school is not united under one mascot, there is often confusion about who to support and this can create a lack of school unity. We, as cheerleaders, want to change that and make every single person in the school feel part of a family, even if they are from different teams and clubs. By providing an environment which promotes school spirit, Stuyvesant Cheer brings the various communities together under the umbrella of “Pegleg Pride”. To help the 3,400 students bond with each other, we participate in spirit days, cheer on our sports teams, and bring pride to Stuyvesant by competing. In addition to promoting school unity, we branch outside of school to provide help to other organizations, such as the Parent Association or St. Jude’s Hospital. While this is outside of the usual description for a cheerleader, we want to inspire other students to do more for their school. As a result, we can create a lasting impression on different people, building a solid network between businesses and other organizations as well as strengthen our school’s reputation. ",@stuycheer,"Prospective cheerleading captains apply for the position by filling out a Google Form that includes questions on why they would like to obtain a leadership position, such as why they want to be captain, what would make them a good captain, and what their goals are for the season. The responses to the form are then released to members of the club, who have two votes each, and are able to pick their top two candidates that they want for senior captain in the upcoming season. After the previous season’s captains count the votes, they use the results to ultimately decide who will fill next year’s senior leadership positions. When the senior captains are chosen and announced, they collaborate to choose a junior captain, based on the Google Form and their history on the team. A captain may be impeached or team member put on probation if they receive three strikes based on the team’s strike system. Any behavior by a captain or team member that contributes to an unhealthy team environment will result in a strike. Members on probation may not attend practices or join the team during pep rallies or on game days. Other protocols team members are expected to follow include keeping a positive attitude at all times, filling out attendance forms for practice 24 hours in advance, and putting in their full effort into every practice. Clear lack of motivation during multiple practices also results in probation for members, and impeachment for captains.
","Stuyvesant High School Cheerleading is a team dedicated to helping promote overall school spirit in many ways, some of which include encouraging our peers to come to our football team’s home games or by cheering on the football team from the sidelines. However, once football season comes to an end, we can choose whether or not we would like to continue our season by continuing to practice for Stunt in the spring and cheering for other teams. We may also begin to prepare for our next routine to compete in Cheer camp. The entire process of preparing a competition routine can be very arduous, and is certainly not for everyone, as it consists of many components: a stunt sequence, cheer, dance, jumps, and a pyramid. Cheerleading requires not only a great deal of athleticism and skill, but also motivation, spirit, and a smile on your face! Members who display a clear lack of interest or effort can be removed from the competition routine to respect those who do work hard and push through the challenges that are thrown at them. Overall, the difficulties our team faces are unlike those that any other athletic teams at our school may experience. While every other sports team is rooting for themselves, we have spirit for Stuyvesant and all of our classmates, regardless of grade, as a whole. ","During the summer, we practice three times a week for two hours on weekdays and three hours on weekends. Two of the three practices will be on a weekday, voted on by the team each year, with the last practice usually on Saturdays. During the school year, we practice until late October once a week for one pep rally and three home football games. Our pep rally and game days are on Fridays. If we decide to cheer for other sports, the same practice regime will continue with one practice a week until that sport's season is over. The one day a week is likely to change based on the availability of our team members. ","['wednesday', 'friday']",medium,"['sports', 'stunt', 'cheerleading']",,"Danica Moser - Captain

Prison Education at Stuyvesant,prisoneducation,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/prisoneducation/da1ce647,Stuy Prison Education Club is an organization dedicated to raising awareness about mass incarceration and how education can mitigate its impact.,"With over two million people in prisons and jails, the US has the highest rate of incarceration of any nation in the world. This shocking statistic is not inclusive of the 840,000 people on parole and 3.6 million people on probation. This system of mass incarceration reaches more than those in prison. It affects us all, especially the 113 million people whose immediate family members have been incarcerated. The Stuy Prison Education Club is a student volunteer organization that aims to bring attention to the widespread effects of incarceration on families and communities, particularly in New York. It will do so by bringing in speakers to share their unique experiences as well as organizing events at Stuyvesant High School. Club members will also participate in volunteer work with NYC community organizations to help those directly impacted by incarceration. Members will also partner with NYU’s Prison Education Program to further their research initiatives on the costs of incarceration. ","The United States prison system affects millions of people, yet there is very little visibility about this issue at Stuyvesant. The Stuy Prison Education Club helps to benefit the Stuyvesant community by raising awareness and creating a safe space for students who may have been personally affected by mass incarceration. This will advance Stuyvesant’s mission of excellence in education by bringing unique voices into the classroom and deepening students' understanding of the inequalities within this country. At a time when many have come to recognize the importance of a diverse student body and curriculum, it is important to foster engagement with communities outside of Stuyvesant’s traditional networks. Stuy Prison Education Club will enable students to do this by emphasizing volunteer work and allowing students to form strong connections with outside organizations. Students will also benefit from working with professors at New York University who will bring a wealth of scholarly and applied knowledge. This will expose students to the most current research on this topic as well as teach students the vital skill of social justice research. Finally, Stuy Prison Education Club’s partnership with New York University will give students insights into the inner workings of the university and to college life in general.

They are responsible for running meetings, communicating with membership and faculty advisors, recruiting new members, and organizing events. They will also maintain contact with the faculty research coordinator at New York University’s Prison Education Program. Each year, the co-presidents will select a community outreach coordinator, whose role will be to develop connections with outside organizations and establish volunteer opportunities.

Stuy FSC utilizes community fridges, city pantries, and soup kitchens in various boroughs to reduce food waste and provide food for the hungry. Members of Stuy FSC will sign up for days when they are available to deliver a portion of the food to a location in the borough they live in. Members are expected to commit to the day that they have signed up for, but there is no minimum number of days members are required to sign up for. Stuy FSC will also provide opportunities to volunteer at local food pantries and soup kitchens on weekends for students who are interested in further helping their communities, gaining volunteer hours, and obtaining new experiences. The establishment of Stuy FSC is especially imperative during these uncertain times as many members in our community are facing economic and social challenges. Join us in this food security initiative to make a better New York and Stuyvesant community.","The Stuyvesant Food Security Club provides an opportunity for students that are motivated to improve the Stuyvesant community and New York City. New York City public schools largely contribute to the rapidly growing food waste issue of NYC. For years, the Stuyvesant school cafeteria has been obligated under DOE regulations to throw out all food items that have left the kitchen on a daily basis. These food items include perfectly fresh apples, oranges, pears, carrots, milk, and cereal. Aside from the canned foods that food pantries offer, our club believes that providing a healthier and more nutritious alternative would be more beneficial to our local communities, while at the same time encouraging a more sustainable school community. Stuy FSC also provides Stuyvesant students with the great opportunity to gain volunteer experience and hours to prepare them for their college application. Not only will students gain personal positive experiences but they will also, at the same time, be contributing to a greater and greener community. Especially in these covid times, many more people are struggling financially, and Stuy FSC believes that Stuyvesnat students can help the whole of New York City. Through our system, our beneficial food security program will allow for the distribution of fresh foods throughout the boroughs of Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan.",Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stuyvesant_food_security_club/?igshid=NzAzN2Q1NTE%3D Website: foodforallnyc.org,"The positions for Stuyvesant Food Security Club include Co- presidents, Chief of Operations, Chief Financial Officer, Manhattan Director, Queens Director, Bronx Director, Brooklyn Director, and Staten Island Director.

Then, the Club Presidents will decide who will take over lower leadership positions based on applicants who show eager participation and commitment. Members are expected to remain active in the club throughout the school year, and those in leadership positions who do not show commitment to the club throughout the year will be removed from their positions by club presidents. In the case that any leadership position holder does not act responsibly and neglects their duties, then the members of the club can write a written complaint to the club presidents and call for a meeting to discuss the member in question. All decisions pertaining to that member will result on a case by case basis through the meeting.","The Stuyvesant Food Security Club is unique from other community service groups in that not only does it provide resources to those in need, but it also encourages a more sustainable community.

Whether you just heard about Formula 1 in passing, or are a fan of the sport, this is a great place to meet new people and convey your opinion about the politics, engineering, and socials of F1. Formula 1 is an intricate sport, with many different fields coming together for the highlight, the Grand Prix races. F1 has a lot of engineering, politics, finance, and opinions involved, and we will be discussing those aspects during meetings. Additionally, after each Grand Prix, we will be analyzing what went down during Free Practices, Qualifying, and the actual race. We will debate about the best teams, drivers, and discuss the history of F1, along with the idols who made the sport what it is now. You do not need to be an expert at Formula 1, as long as you have an interest, you are welcome. (AKA: We are a no-cut, no-tryout activity)
","Formula 1 is a professional sport that attracts fans from all different parts of the word. Through StuyF1, we hope to spread this passion to others, and take a look at different motorsport leagues. We want to make this club a place where members can freely express their ideas, opinions, and creativity in auto racing. Providing a place to express ones ideas is important as it creates a sense of belonging and increases the ability of public speaking. From this, as the activity becomes larger, we plan to create activities in which the entire school can participate in, and allow them to join if they wish. This strongly supports inclusion, as we do not discriminate in any way or form, nor support bullying in any way or form. We are committed to creating and supporting environments that reflect the diversity of Stuyvesant High School. We believe that everyone benefits from diverse and inclusive surroundings. We do our best to welcome and support all students and school staff. Because this is a club where communication and debate are crucial parts, we hope to help create new friendships and have people come together and support the passion of Formula 1 and the general racing community.
",,"StuyF1 will have a president, vice president, director of media, and a secretary. The president and vice president are responsible for the overall management of the club and will have partial control of the club's legal and financial situations. The director of media is responsible for updating the clubs social media accounts, as well as help manage the club's website. The secretary is responsible for taking general notes about what happened during meetings. Transfer of leadership will happen at the end of each school year. As StuyF1 is a democratic club, presidents and vice presidents will be selected through an election. Candidates will be approved based on their participation, dedication, and interest. After the election, the candidate with the top number of votes will be president, and the candidate with the second most number of votes will be elected vice president. After they have been confirmed, the president and vice president will nominate members to be director of media and secretary. The nominees have the right to accept or decline the offer. In the event that a leader abuses their role, an investigation will be immediately launched, with a vote at the end regarding the future of the defendant. 
","There are no currently active clubs about or related to F1, FIA Motorsports, or any other auto racing leagues. As a club dedicated to Formula 1 racing, we are the first to bring together students and discuss about racing. This is a one of a kind activity that cannot be compared to any other clubs, as there are no other active racing clubs. We are proud to be a semi-pioneer in this field, and hope to use this to advance the prestige of StuyF1
","While our meeting schedule will change based on the official F1 calendar, we will meet at least 2 times a month in the winter, and at least 3 times in the spring and fall. We will most definitely meet after each Grand Prix weekend.

Big Sibs are assigned to homerooms of the incoming freshman class to help them get acclimated to life at Stuyvesant. We run major events at Stuyvesant, from the Open Houses to Camp Stuy pt. I & II, and Parent Orientation. Big Sibs stay with their homerooms for the entire year, organizing events and serving as a resource to new members of the Stuyvesant community.

All members of the Big Sib organizations are asked first and foremost to be welcoming and helpful members of the Stuyvesant community. It is important that we give the incoming classes responsible upperclassmen to look up and reach out to. All members are required to attend significant events throughout the school year, attend homerooms regularly, and be a model to their assigned homerooms. We pride ourselves on being one of the largest service organizations at Stuyvesant, and we take pride in the character of our organization that is derived from our members.""","""The Big Sib program is an essential part of Stuyvesant High School.

As Big Sibs, our members are assigned to incoming students' homerooms and are asked to develop working relationships with those students. We are here to make their transition to Stuyvesant as painless as possible, and to serve as a friendly face to our new students. Big Sibs help by providing advice to new students, recommendations for activities to pursue at Stuyvesant, and most importantly, serving as an intermediary between new students and the guidance department.

One of the primary jobs of the Big Sib program is to make events such as Open Houses and Camp Stuy possible. The Big Sibs run Open Houses in the fall and spring, which can see over 9,000+ attendees of prospective students/families in one night. During this time, Big Sibs lead tours and answer questions of potential students and their families throughout these nights. Camp Stuy (parts I and II) are held during June and August, respectively. Big Sibs by this time are assigned homerooms, and are responsible for: getting to know their homeroom members, making sure incoming students are getting properly tested and set up for their four years at Stuyvesant, and make the transition period more enjoyable.

At the moment with COVID circumstances, the Big Sib program has continued to do as much as possible to make sure the incoming class is transitioning smoothly. Events like virtual homeroom check-ins and a Virtual Field Day and Concert has become possible in place of the usual Homeroom Picnics or Camp Stuy Part 2. The program will continue to adjust throughout this new period of time and help the freshmen as per usual be the most comfortable as they enter Stuyvesant High School

The Big Sib program is a friendly face on the often tumultuous time that transitions to Stuyvesant can be. Ergo, every member regards their job as a Big Sib to be critical to the school.""",https://www.instagram.com/stuybigsibs/,"""Appointment to the position of Chair of the Big Sib organization (of which there are five spots), is done via a lengthy application process. Only current Junior Big Sibs are eligible to apply. First, a written application is required which asks applicants to answer a series of questions about the organization and their ideas for the coming school year. Next, applicants are asked to obtain two recommendations from their Little Sibs and one recommendation from their homeroom leader. After this, the applicant's strikes are considered as a factor of their commitment to the organization. Finally, all applicants are given an interview whose members consist of the current Big Sib Chairs, Ms. Pedrick, and the Faculty Oversight Committee.

Big Sibs are all held accountable on a strike system. If a Big Sib misses two (2) big events without an excuse submitted by a predetermined time period, their continued membership will be placed into question. Beyond that, Big Sibs have a limit of three (3) unexcused strikes.

Chairs of the Big Sibs organization are asked to abide by a code of ethics detailed upon their appointment by Ms. Pedrick and the Faculty Oversight Committee. If they are found to be in violation of this code of conduct, their position will be placed into question and terminated by the aforementioned people/groups.""","The Big Sib program is the only program at Stuyvesant that is an offshoot of one of our departments here, that being the Guidance department.

StuyCooks,stuycooks,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuycooks/45eb41b1,StuyCooks seeks to develop practical cooking skills among Stuyvesant students and explore different cooking experiences.,"StuyCooks aims to give its members the skills, confidence, and ideas to begin and cultivate a love for cooking. We would start the club by teaching them about fundamental home cooking practices. These introductory lessons would include kitchen tools, pantry essentials, and cutting and cooking techniques. This foundational information will give our members the necessary skill set to let them start cooking in their own kitchen. We will continue the year by leaving the home kitchen and examining the world of restaurant cooking, an entirely different environment. Nonetheless, the restaurant environment still has many skills that can be transferred to home cooking.

StuyCooks also seeks to expand the horizons of what foods students eat and share an invitation to try cooking and enjoying different cultures, giving students a more comprehensive view of food and cooking.

 Members will cook a dish according to a rotating theme each week and present their dish alongside their recipe, experience, techniques, and some additional information, such as any personal or cultural significance of the plate. They are also expected to help other members who may not understand how or why food is cooked using certain techniques and encourage those who wish to learn more about different cultures.
","Cooking is a skill that is rarely appreciated, and yet it is one of the most crucial life skills. This Club will teach students various techniques and skills in cooking, expanding students’ awareness of cooking and encouraging them to cook new foods and explore the cultures where the foods originated from. It will also increase students’ understanding of food science, why ingredients and hardware are used for cooking foods in different ways, and how to adapt recipes they find anywhere to their own needs. In this way, cooking increases the flexibility and adaptability of students, as finding substitutions or different ways to cook a dish is a challenge that requires a lot of creativity to solve. 

Cooking also increases students’ awareness of what they eat, as they control what they put in their food and encourages healthy eating. It breaks the stereotype that healthy eating and living are either incredibly expensive or bland. It also makes students more aware of their actions and responsibilities, as cooking involves careful attention to detail. The need to keep their cooking space tidy and clean, the necessity of consistent maintenance in the kitchen, and the ability to multitask and manage time efficiently before, during, and after cooking can transfer out into other activities as well. The relatively low stakes of cooking for themselves teaches responsibility to students. 

 Cooking also provides a social outlet for students. Students can make friends and connections over cooking, and it can deepen friendships and relationships. Cooking for others provides an outlet for stress, and it contributes to good mental metal to see others enjoying the fruits of your labor. 
",https://discord.gg/C5hkPh2mSn,"The current leading members appoint two leaders. Members who would be considered for leadership applications need to show demonstrated interest in cooking and food science, show leadership qualities, and have an ability to cook and teach those skills to others. Members can nominate others using a form to recommend someone to become leader as years change, and those recommended may be considered more highly for the position.
Members are expected to respect each other as well as encourage each other on their cooking journey. All cultures are to be respected. Members should not demean strange or unconventional cooking methods unless there is a clear disadvantage of using it. Limitations in cooking hardware and dietary restrictions should be respected as well.
Being a leader does NOT mean that they are the best cook in the club. While skill is a factor, the ability to work well and teach others takes utmost priority, as the survival of the club is dependent on people that can clearly and respectfully share their views on cooking. 

Should a leader fail to meet expectations, or is no longer dedicated, they can be removed from their position by a vote, a removal requires 2/3 of the club to vote yes.","No other club at Stuyvesant offers such a deep dive into cooking, and of such a broad nature and open to everyone. Because we seek to focus on cooking techniques rather than the experience of eating the food, we are not limited by a focus on one specific culture. This also allows us to apply techniques across cultures, taking the best parts of each culture and the ones that suit our needs to use. This allows students to reach out and learn about those cultures, which they might never have done without this diversity of the club.

Stuyvesant Chess Club,chessclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/chessclub/15136e2b,To provide students interested in chess an opportunity to come together and play.,"""The Stuyvesant Chess Club meets every Monday for lessons and hosts tournaments on Wednesdays. The club aims at providing students with an interest in chess an opportunity to come together and bond in a friendly environment. Students who may want to improve their skills through playing games, reading, and discussing techniques, or who may just want to relax and have fun, are all welcome. No USCF rating is necessary. During the lessons on Mondays, we analyze games, learn vital middlegame/endgame techniques and strategies, and teach the thought process of successful players. Both members of the Chess Team and less ambitious players come to our club. The club is open to the entire student body, and has no commitment requirement; those with an interest can come and go at their ease. During our tournaments and practice games on Wednesdays, chess club members get the opportunity to compete with their fellow schoolmates.
""","Chess has a long history of being a problem-solving game. Chess may strengthen a student’s logical reasoning skills by giving them opportunities of calculating the opponent’s possible moves and reactions to a particular situation. But since we are human, we must decide which moves are worth calculating and which are not. Chess players can develop skills at both tactics, the well-calculated moves that may grant you an advantage or even victory, and strategy, the utilization of the positioning of pieces to impose yourself upon the opponent, and force them into a less favorable situation. Hence, it should be more understandable why the chess grandmaster Bobby Fischer famously said, “Chess is life.” Although situations on the chess board are most likely not as complex as those in real life, the different ways to think about a problem can be useful in reality, and can probably make one more intimate with his/her thought processes. On the other hand, chess can simply be relaxing, and students may like the taste of playing for its excitement, barely thinking before making the next move, testing his/her instincts at the game with a similar-strength opponent. Winning a chess game or solving a difficult chess puzzle may contribute towards self-confidence and can exercise both sides of the brain. Additionally, by joining the chess club, students will have the opportunity to volunteer at various chess organizations. ",https://www.facebook.com/groups/stuychess,"""The activity appoints leaders on the basis of their commitment to the club, approval of the faculty advisor, and grade level. The leaders of the club are determined by the faculty advisor and popular opinion, and is entrusted with a key to the chess equipment. At least one leader must show up at each meeting to unlock the drawers where the chess set and clocks are. Club members should make sure everything is cleaned up, locked back, with no pieces fallen on the floor, before leaving the room. When the faculty advisor is not present, the club should be dismissed before 17:00. Skill is not a very important factor in the appointment process for club leadership. It is often seniors who filled leadership positions in the past, though juniors have a chance based on commitment and space availability. Impeachment, then, should follow failure to come regularly to the club for these procedures, or other events that makes said person untrustworthy. The club faculty advisor has the highest authority on such affairs.
""","Our club is dedicated to an ancient board game. Throughout the past centuries, the game evolved. The strategies and game plans have changed drastically in just the past few decades because of computer engines. New ideas are constantly being created. With endless possibilities, chess allows a person to control their own fate. Unlike many other games, every decision lies in your own hands. One can meet at the Chess Club students of various personalities and styles, skill levels and professionality.

StuyBio’s operations are split into three branches, the Events Branch, the Study Branch, and the Secretarial Branch. StuyBio distributes study resources under its Study Branch, some of which include original lecture-style PowerPoint presentations, access to different college-level textbooks, and weekly problem sets. Some exciting events that members may expect to see from the Events Branch include screenings of eye-opening science films, mock USABO examinations, debates on hot topics in biology research and bioethics, live lab demonstrations, and discussions of innovative research papers with the goal of cultivating a deeper understanding of biology. Behind the scenes, the Secretarial Branch coordinates board activities and outside collaborations among other responsibilities like designing posters used to advertise club activities and managing the website, timeline, and social media. The three branches of StuyBio work together to realize StuyBio’s mission and immerse members in the study of biology.

Students joining StuyBio are heavily encouraged and expected to participate in both lessons and events. In doing so, members not only prepare themselves to explore biology in a self-paced manner that extends beyond the classroom, but also get the opportunity to meet other passionate biologists and make lasting relationships!","StuyBio provides members with a unique selection of resources and an environment that will nurture their love for biology and help them advance their interests in the field, be it academically or professionally, beyond high school. The club welcomes an all-inclusive spectrum of students with varying experience in biology, as StuyBio seeks to inspire a genuine interest in biology within every member. StuyBio members have access to a plethora of resources, such as detailed lessons, original problem sets written by board members, recordings of club meetings, a variety of undergraduate and graduate-level textbooks, and individualized tutoring by upperclassmen who have experience with the content and format of the USABO and have seen success in previous years. The monthly events are another great way for members to engage and gain firsthand experience with various aspects of biology all the while building meaningful relationships with like-minded peers. Members also gain access to an extensive archive of lessons and materials from previous years, which they may utilize to solidify their understanding of concepts introduced during club meetings. And perhaps most important of all, StuyBio offers members the opportunity to immerse themselves in a community that is both relaxed and fun, while also keeping the academic rigor characteristic of Stuyvesant. Anyone struggling with biology is more than welcome to join, and StuyBio can help them understand any difficult concepts, ensuring that they can excel in both present and future biology coursework. ",,"At the conclusion of every school year, the StuyBio board conducts a leadership recruitment cycle to welcome a new board for the next year. Members who have been a part of the club for at least one year and who have demonstrated their devotion to the club both as an active member and as someone who strives to utilize their skill set in service of the club, are encouraged to submit an application form designed to gather information about their past leadership experience and relevant coursework. After a thorough round of submissions review, the President and Vice Presidents will then schedule an interview with strong applicants to discuss their application and gauge how they may fit into the larger landscape of the board. Based on the results of the interview, the current board may schedule a position-specific technical analysis session. Applicants must demonstrate a deep passion for biology, strong leadership skills, and the ability to collaborate and take initiative. Finally, applicants are notified by email of their final application results.

Currently, StuyBio’s leadership positions are as follows: President (1), Vice President (2), Secretary (2), Event Director (3), and Teaching Advisor (2). As leaders of the club, their roles may include but are not limited to: teaching lessons, leading board meetings, organizing and hosting events, reaching out to prospective members, and looking over the emotional welfare of other members. If any leader emotionally or physically hurts any other member or neglects their roles as leaders, they are prone to impeachment. If any member emotionally or physically hurts any other member, they will be forcibly removed from the club. Members are expected to actively participate in and attend meetings held by the club.

This is why StuyBio caters resources to and welcomes all students coming from varying levels of exposure and experience to biology. Although preparing for the USABO examinations can be intense and challenging, StuyBio seeks to bring a distinct collaborative approach to studying by delivering high-quality materials and encouraging insightful discourse amongst members. In combination with its biweekly lessons and engaging events, StuyBio ensures all members a uniquely complete high school biology experience, enabling them to not only explore advanced biology topics through several lenses but also to then apply their newfound knowledge and see their hard work pay off.","The scheduled dates of pop-up meetings may vary from month to month, but two pop-up lessons will be hosted as well as a specialized lesson conducted every week.

Stuyvesant Book Club,stuybookclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuybookclub/f4890753,"Here, you'll find passionate readers, wholesome evenings, and captivating weekly discussions on a variety of books!
","The idea for our book club was born from a common sentiment: “I wish I had someone to talk to about this book I just read!” The club’s purpose is to provide that community for passionate readers at Stuy, as well as create a sense of belonging. That will be done primarily through weekly discussions on books in a range of genres. Another purpose Book Club serves is offering a time and place to unwind during the hectic school year, as reading can offer great benefits that Stuy students tend to neglect in their day to day grind. However, being that there a new book every month and it is not necessary to come to the weekly meetings, this is a low commitment club and won’t eat up your time, aside from reading ahead of time. Along with discussing the books themselves, we will have watch parties about adaptations of the books we read! Our ultimate goal for the Stuyvesant Book Club is to simply have a good time as we delve deeper into understanding both the books we read and ourselves through discussion.
","This activity will benefit Stuyvesant in a multitude of ways. For one, the number of benefits that come from reading are endless: cultural sensitivity, learning about a number of different subjects, developing empathy and human decency, and a larger vocabulary to pull from. But in addition to giving people an incentive (and in turn, all those benefits) to read, Book Club grants them an escape - an incentive to read something other than textbooks, to not feel the weight of responsibility or the pressure of a grade looming over them when picking a piece of literature. It grants them the chance to make friends, to interact with others with similar interests and a chance for freedom of discussion. It grants them the authority to make decisions and chance for freedom. Book Club is a chance to bring together people from various groups and from all over Stuyvesant. It also brings about very important discussions, not only about social issues (racism, sexism, homophobia), but also about the relevance of literature in our current society, the evolution of language, and how varying forms of media are taking over. Also: what defines a novel, what makes it well-written or a game-changer. Or on the flipside, a terrible novel and what are the characteristics that make it so.
",Instagram: @stuybookclub,"Because Stuy Book Club is a community-driven club, the leaders trust one another to be truthful and clear about everything related to the matters of this club. If there ever comes a point where a leader of the club becomes complacent or irresponsible, it is upon both the other leader and the members themselves to recognize when it's time to end the deal. It is imperative that both leaders of the club are punctual and prepared all if not almost all of the time. If they can’t make it to a meeting, they must let the other know at least a day in advance. As it stands now, the leaders are currently under agreement that we will be communicative and dedicated, and if the time arises that this agreement is being undermined or ignored, the proper impeachment procedure will follow. Additionally, any form of disrespect or intolerance displayed both during or outside of meetings won’t be tolerated. In terms of appointing future leaders once current ones graduate or are no longer able to lead, there will be a fair application process available to all that are interested.
","For one, the freedom. It's easy to say that book club is essentially a second English class, but that's not true at all! What this club does that differs from other literary clubs is allow freedom in all aspects. The leaders come prepared to lead discussions based on main points in the books and questions they feel are important, but the discussion is really left to the club members and is essentially led by them!

Stuy Music Analytics,musicanalytics,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/musicanalytics/c8069bea,"This club encourages lively discussions and debates about the meanings behind various lyrics and other musical elements.
","The purpose of the Music Analytics club is to foster deeper thoughts regarding the elements of musical pieces. Some of the topics discussed will involve modern-day issues, as well as literary elements like figurative language. During the meetings, a song will be chosen from a list of pieces compiled by the members. The club will display and listen to the music before hosting light-hearted discussions revolving around the hidden meanings behind the lyrics and the intended message of the song. This will be a fun place for students of different ages and grade levels to meet and create long-lasting connections based on shared hobbies and interests. The low commitment element of the club creates a fun, stress-free environment, perfect for winding down and socializing. This club allows students to widen their musical horizons, expose themselves to new genres and artists, and become more familiar with different forms of metaphors, similes, and other figurative languages.","This activity allows students to express their opinions without the constraints of a classroom-based environment. It is very beneficial to the Stuyvesant community because it will provide students with the opportunity to learn about various musical genres and explore the world of figurative language, therefore creating a much more diverse and artistic space. The club is not just designed for students with a particular musical interest, but can also be for avid music-listeners who are outspoken and are interested in debating. However, this activity doesn't require participation, so it can also be an interesting experience to listen to the debates without feeling pressured to engage or share your opinion. Members can come to meetings knowing it is an inclusive space where all of their opinions are valued. As a fun, low commitment club, it can be a refreshing experience to unwind and explore the world of music while taking a break from school and other responsibilities. Students can meet friends and use this club as a way to get more comfortable interacting with others and improve their peer-communication skills. The friendly environment will create a pleasant space where people can get outside of their comfort zones and learn new things about music each meeting.",https://www.instagram.com/stuymusicanalytics/,"In the Music Analytics club, there are two co-leaders. There will be a google form sent out at the beginning of the year for applications for other leadership positions. Any member can fill the google form out and the current co-leaders will review the responses. It will be a short form and will ask questions about the prior commitments of the applicants, as well as some personal information. There will also be questions about their interest in the job and how they will contribute to the club. The form is for applying to be one of three executives. The executives will handle administrative duties. Members will ether keep their positions until graduation or apply for a leadership role in the club at the beginning of each year. Members are expected to be open-minded. They should feel no pressure to participate, although it is, of course, recommended that they engage in the conversation for the best experience possible. Members should attend as many meetings as possible and should notify the leaders if they are unavailable to meet at a certain time. They should actively check email for posts on StuyActivities and meeting notifications.
","Rather than focusing on presentations and mandatory individual work, the Music Analytics club focuses on creating an open environment. By not assigning work or any other requirements, the club allows students to become more engaged in the discussed topics. By giving its members a choice in the music selection, they will be much more interested in the analytical discussion during the meetings. The club is also very flexible with its meetings to help students manage their other commitments.

","Stuyvesant Biotech’s purpose is to provide students with easy and accessible information for gaining a competitive edge in the biotechnology field. This information is mostly taught through meetings that can be held bi-weekly while information for new outside activities and opportunities will be provided continuously. Due to the bi-weekly schedule, students involved are expected to attend at least 1 meeting every month to ensure they are sufficiently prepared alongside the other members of the club. Outside volunteering work and fun activities are completely optional for members and serve to help students be more involved and hands-on. General members can also vote in polls to make any wanted changes or possibly to add new events to engage more students. Members of Stuyvesant Biotech are expected and encouraged to create a welcoming environment to provide others with learning, networking, and social skills for the future while also maintaining a fun atmosphere for not just learning but also building a community.

","As the biotechnology industry involves close collaboration with ideas from both the biological and technological fields, it is a very specific industry yet one that many stem students at Stuyvesant can find intriguing. The activity helps to bolster this interest and provide sufficient opportunities to these students. Students coming to the meetings will meet with others with common interests and deepen not only their own knowledge in the field but also improve their networking skills. Students can broaden information on topics in the biotech field as well as learn skills and tips in gaining an advantage in the field that otherwise would usually have been gained through long work and experience. In addition, we will analyze innovations both throughout history and in current news media, such as articles and videos. This will help give members a sense of depth as to how the industry of biotechnology has evolved over time. Students can also find activities for math, biology, and technology related opportunities, utilizing both the Internet and other bulletins they find online. If available, possible outside scholarship opportunities, fun activities, and volunteering work will also be made more visible for students. Then, students who pursued these activities can also have the opportunity to present their findings and their experience to other members.


",@stuybiotech,"The leadership positions include the president, vice-president, social media manager, community outreach manager, and research manager. The president is the face of the organization and is thus expected to be at every meeting. In addition, the president is expected to present the majority of the content in every meeting. In addition, the president must be adept and handling issues concerning both the organization in general and issues concerning specific positions. The president is appointed by others nominating themselves or others, as well as interviews and a final vote. The vice president is expected to be at the majority of meetings and may be required to take over if the president is unavailable for a certain amount of time. The vice-president is also elected in the same manner as the president. The social media manager is expected to run the StuyBiotech Instagram page and create posts for meetings, as well as create 'warmup' posts about what we will be covering in the meeting later that week. They will be chosen based on their experience with social media in other organizations and personally. The community outreach manager answers questions during the online Zoom meetings and will arrange for others to share their experiences concerning certain activities. The research manager finds new opportunities for Stuyvesant students to pursue in the field of biotechnology and is expected to share either at the beginning or end of each meeting. Both of these positions will be nominated based on their previous experience and an interview with the rest of the board. Impeachment will only be pursued if a majority of the rest of the board votes to do so.


","Our organization is specifically dedicated to the teaching of biotechnology to other students. We go above and beyond what is normally considered ‘biotechnology’ and utilize both past and present innovations to teach other students how our evolution in the field of biotechnology has influenced us today. We also will actively search and provide opportunities for students to also get involved into this field if they are interested. This way, we can also have other students possibly present their findings and experience to the rest of the club.

Personal Stuynance,PersonalStuynance,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/PersonalStuynance/35c1b804,Personal Stuynance’s mission is to make financial knowledge easily accessible to anyone.,"Personal finance is essential knowledge for today’s world. Amid chaotic markets and rampant inflation, international disputes and rising costs of living, managing one’s money is a skill people can’t be successful without. 

Personal Stuynance makes financial concepts easy to understand and access, and makes them relevant to everyone. This is, from its conception, a beginner-friendly club. No member is expected to come in with any kind of prior knowledge, and Personal Stuynance aims to give its members an easy-to-understand background and a foothold in financial literacy. The club focuses on practical knowledge that applies to daily life, delivered in short, simple meetings without excessive “buzzword” or “mindset” talk. 

Each meeting is intended to be simple and beginner-friendly. Each meeting should stand on its own, and be able to be understood by anyone regardless of prior knowledge. Personal Stuynance knows that a major fraction of people are uncomfortable with finances and the stock market - an early 2022 poll by Allianz, a financial services company, shows that 43% of American adults are “too nervous to invest in the market”. In high schoolers, who are more inexperienced with finance, this number can only be higher. Personal Stuynance aims to address this issue and bring financial literacy to all - regardless of how much they already know. The club brings knowledge about all aspects of the financial world into a simple, easy-to-grasp series of club sessions and allows any and all participants to learn something new and useful.

In short, Personal Stuynance is a club that anyone can walk into a meeting of, and walk out of that one meeting knowing something that will help them financially, regardless of what that person’s prior knowledge was.

Members and lecture attendees will learn the basics of tax-advantaged savings and investment accounts, develop passive investment skills to maximize their return with minimal active involvement, and learn the key systems that run the financial world, like banking, taxes, and market trends. Members are expected to attend meetings and guest lectures, and also are encouraged to apply what they learn in the club.
","Personal Stuynance provides simple and understandable financial literacy for all.

When someone is not financially literate, they suffer. Financially illiterate people are almost six times as likely to struggle trying to make ends meet, and five times more likely to be unable to provide one month’s living expenses without working, according to a Global Financial Literacy Center survey in April 2022. Financial literacy is an absolute necessity for today’s fast-paced world,with high inflation decimating savings accounts and skyrocketing costs of living all over the world. Living without basic financial knowledge is like trying to live with one lung, or trying to write with a stub pencil. Financial literacy allows people a cushion, over three times more likely to be able to provide for themselves in the case of an $1000 unexpected expense. This knowledge is a necessity for anyone, including Stuy students.

Stuyvesant has great academic prowess, definitely - but the financial literacy aspect of our school is severely underdeveloped. Economics courses mostly deal with the global and national economy, barely addressing how those economic concepts affect an individual, and even less about what an individual can do about their financial situation. This is where Personal Stuynance comes in. This club provides anyone who attends meetings with understandable, simple, yet practical knowledge on how to deal with their own financial situation and improve their outlook for the future. This club allows Stuyvesant students to gain essential skills and knowledge on dealing with money - invaluable information in this time of market unpredictability and high inflation. Traditional approaches like savings accounts, in this climate, will lead to your money losing buying power over time. Everyone, including Stuyvesant students, needs to know how to stay ahead of the curve and preserve and hopefully grow the value of their money.

In this society, money is everything. Members of this club will learn the fundamentals of dealing with their own money, and building financial foundations for the rest of life.
",,"Three club members form the club leadership, the President and at least two, and no more than four, Co-Presidents. Currently these club directors are the Co-President of Assets and the Co-President of Markets. Co-Presidents build activities and club curriculum based on their areas of expertise indicated in their titles. The President oversees club curriculum as well as coordinates activities and outreach. 
Leadership members are appointed when there would be less than two co-presidents or no president present in the next school year. At the end of one of the leadership members’ senior year, the current leadership will select their successor from interested members (interest and members’ motivations are first gauged through a Google form). Members who pass the Google form stage then attend interviews with all leadership members. Leadership members must be approved by consensus of all current previous-year leadership members. 
Leadership members can initiate step-down procedures at any time. However, the leadership member stepping down must continue to fulfill their role until a successor is appointed, if a successor is necessary. If a successor is not necessary, that member may stop their duties at the end of the meeting after the other leadership members are informed of the step-down. If the club president steps down, a successor must be selected. If a club director steps down, a successor must be selected if there are less than two directors remaining. Otherwise, a successor may be selected if the president determines it necessary. If a leadership member steps down, a new leadership member must be selected through an interest and preliminary assessment form, interviews, and full leadership consensus as detailed above. 
Impeachment of any leadership member, reverting them to a normal member, is done through votes of no confidence — one other leadership member initiates the vote, and over half of the club population must agree to impeach the member. Any impeached leadership member may not become a leadership member again in the future, at any time.","Financial literacy and approaching topics like investing and personal finance can be threatening and intimidating for most people. The stock market is a frightening beast, and putting your money into it without proper background is undeniably risky. We don't drop members directly into a “stock market game” or advanced topics like derivative trading and market algorithms immediately- we provide a informational, fact-based base of knowledge for members. Stuyvesant needs a place for people to gain and grasp basic knowledge of their financial well-being, like what “the markets” even are and how to grow their money in those markets without unnecessary overcomplication. 
Personal Stuynance aims to give club members a solid foundation in finance and investment. Instead of jumping right into complicated terms and investing, this club would make the daunting concept of personal finance beginner-friendly. This would make the club accessible to those who might not have prior knowledge about economics or any background in the area. Since personal finance is undeniably an important skill to have throughout life, it’s important to build this strong background early, which is what this club would do.","Since many people at Stuyvesant are in multiple clubs or have other responsibilities after school, club members can vote at the beginning of the year to decide which days work best for everyone. These times can then be adjusted throughout the year, but occur at least once a month and often more.",['thursday'],low,"['finance', 'easy', 'helpful']","While Personal Stuynance is most definitely beginner-oriented, it also encourages and welcomes more financially knowledgeable members. At the tail end of each session, more advanced discussions will be held, and more knowledgeable members can help out the beginner members as they learn.","Ethan Khosh - President

Known throughout the world, origami is intimately interconnected with math and science. Many of the most well-known folders being former MIT students or even NASA scientists. Take Robert J Lang who quit being a Nasa laser physicist to pursue origami full time for example. Due to origami's reputation and usefulness, StuyOrigami sets out to provide Stuy students with a place to pursue any interest they have in origami. StuyOrigami also helps with holidays and events. Former Stuy students may have seen the paper decorations we've created for holidays and events. It is a club tradition to outfit the library with trees and reindeer for Christmas, pumpkins for Halloween, and more. StuyOrigami helps give a little bit of fun to parts of the school with an activity that at its roots helps honor the STEM history of the school. The nature of origami is such so that it’s incredibly cheap and easy to start has so much below the surface if one chooses to continue learning.",,"Leadership is split between the president and vice-president who can appoint additional help if necessary. The president will organize the meeting schedule and agenda while planning larger projects that club members can contribute to. While not having any strict responsibilities, the vice-president will aid the president in organizing larger projects and carry out tasks asked of them by the president. Any suggestions raised by the rest of the club will be taken into consideration. The president and vice-president will stay in power until they graduate or step down. In the event of a vacancy(ies), the previous president or vice-president must pick a successor(s). If only the president is stepping down, then the vice-president will take over as president and a new vice-president will be chosen. In the event that either leader proves themselves unsatisfactory or are abusing their power, a club member may take it up with the president or vice-president and an anonymous vote will be carried out. If two-thirds of the vote (rounded down) agrees with the impeachment, it will be carried out. The vice-president will become the new president, if need be, and a new vice-president will be appointed.

It is more complex than it seems with roots in math and science, along with types of paper needing to be taken into consideration as one goes into more advanced designs. Simultaneously it is also an easy art to get into with the only starting materials needed being a piece of paper, whether copy or even post-its. Being the only club to focus on origami, we can explore further and teach more advance techniques that have developed within the art.

Each month, our club hosts guest speaker events in which students can hear about frontier research and explore various branches of psychology from current professionals. Past guest speakers have included professors from top research universities such as Columbia University and NYU. As part of the Wellness Coalition, the Pstuychology club works closely with Mr. Colon and other student wellness clubs, to participate in school-wide events like the Health Fair. Members of the club will gain hands-on experience through psychology-related projects, club presentations, and other fun activities. They will also gain meaningful insights into the field of psychology and explore different social issues, such as the impact of social media on the brain and the validity of witness testimony. Pstuychology provides a fun and collaborative environment that allows for students to consult one another on various topics and have hearty discussions on the merits of different psychology ideas.","Stuyvesant students will have an opportunity to learn about psychology in layman’s terms. Members will be able to interact with in-field experts, participate in lecture discussions and projects, and enhance their understanding of various psychology topics. Students taking AP Psychology can also expand their knowledge beyond the curriculum and gain an idea of career prospects by connecting with college professors and practitioners. This can be a great way to explore AP Psychology even if one is not enrolled in the course, as much of our material is based on similar topics to the AP curriculum. In addition, students may receive extra credit from their teachers for attending guest speaker events, but they are still fun to come to regardless. There are relaxing activities, such as yoga sessions, and also informational activities, where students can listen to lectures and provide their own opinions. With the Wellness Coalition, Pstuychology is able to provide health information to an even broader range of clubs.

Stuyvesant Lacrosse Club,stuyvesantlacrosse,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyvesantlacrosse/45701111,To improve members' lacrosse skills prior to the spring lacrosse season.,"Stuy Lacrosse Club is meant to provide students (both female and male) with the opportunity to play the underappreciated sport of lacrosse. Whether you have absolutely no experience and have never even seen a lacrosse stick, or you have played for years, the club will welcome you with open arms. We will go over the basics of lacrosse, such as rules and positions, and have kids practice the fundamentals: passing, catching, ground balls, and cradling. Soon, we will progress to more complex parts of the game like formations and plays and actually run those plays so the students can get a feel of what it is like to be in a real game. Hopefully, by the end of the club, those who showed dedication and commitment will find themselves trying out for either the Huskies Lacrosse team or the Peglegs Lacrosse team and secure themselves a spot. We want enthusiastic and skilled players who are committed to the game, and to improving themselves so we can create a new generation of Stuyvesant Lacrosse players that have a strong base, so once we graduate, we know the team will be left in good hands.","This activity will benefit Stuyvesant by providing students a means of accessing such a underappreciated sport when they otherwise would be unable to. It will also greatly improve the quality of the varsity teams and lead to more victories. The season starts in the spring, so having students train and practice this early on would give our teams an edge, especially with the new recruits. Lacrosse is not a sport easily mastered without guidance, as the equipment isn't readily available and not many opportunities exist outside of school for this sport. Thus, there is no other way to appeal to new, inexperienced players and make sure they are able to compete. Additionally, this will provide an opportunity for current members of the team to practice and sharpen up their skills prior to the season starting, and gives a chance for them to bond with new potential teammates. All of these reasons will not only improve the lacrosse teams at Stuy but also make the school a better place. Having students involved in sports and trying different things is what Stuyvesant is about, and giving the students the opportunity to really try something new and interesting will make for a far happier student body.",https://www.instagram.com/stuylax/,"The leaders of the Lacrosse Club will be the current captains/junior captains of the team. Captains for the lacrosse team are chosen by the coach or voted for at the end of each season. This may vary year to year depending on what the coach of the PSAL teams see fit. If anything were to happen for them to be removed as captain, such as disciplinary action or removal from the team, then they would also be removed as a leader of the club. Members are expected to treat each other with respect and help each other improve their lacrosse skills and work as if they were on a team because that's really what the club represents. It's an opportunity for people to have a glimpse of what it means on the team, and they should act as if they are on it if they want to truly be a part of it. Members who are already on the lacrosse team will be expected to be more committed as they will need the practice to play well during the season, and the newcomers will be encouraged to come as often as they can. If they cannot make it or lose interest, that is fine, but our goal is to make the environment as welcoming as possible so that doesn't happen.","Lacrosse isn't a very well-known sport, and as a result, the opportunities available for it are rare. Outside of school, it's difficult to find a league for students to participate in, and even then, those cost money and time - something students might not have much of. Thus, this club will allow them to experience this amazing sport without having to sacrifice a lot. No other club exists in Stuy for the purpose of lacrosse, and this will be a great opportunity to increase the outreach and awareness of our lacrosse team.","We will hold practices around twice a week, depending on the schedule and what fields are available.

StuyGivology,StuyGivology,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/StuyGivology/28a8097d,"Givology at Stuy aims to aid and spread the mission of Givology, a non-profit that advocates education for underprivileged communities.
","
As the Stuyvesant chapter of Givology, we hope to find like-minded advocates for education within our school community. Our motto is “Learn to give, give to learn.” Globally, nearly 1 out of every 5 children of primary-school age are not in school, 40% of secondary-age children don't attend school, and even more do not have the opportunity to pursue higher education. We feel that as Stuyvesant students who are privileged enough to have access to high quality education, we should be advocating for students who haven’t had the same opportunities. Education is an essential resource to empowering individuals, advancing communities, and alleviating poverty. Since poverty is the principal cause of children not being able to acquire quality education, we hope to play a small role in combating that with this initiative. Through the school year, we’ll be holding both chapter-exclusive fundraising events, as well as larger Givology events. We’re committed to donor transparency and maximizing the impact of every dollar we raise. Members are expected to be a part of and help organize fundraising initiatives, spread word about Givology’s projects and mission, as well as attend most weekly meetings, where we’ll discuss future fundraising events and other logistics. 
","As Stuyvesant students, we are privileged enough to already have many opportunities that other communities may not have access to due to factors out of their control, such as funding deficits and lack of staff. With Givology, we can use our privilege as a platform to aid others, who don’t share the same advantages as us. Givology plans to hold various fundraising events throughout the school year that’ll both appeal to the student body and help the community stay engaged. Givology’s mission allows us to create unity and friendships among our peers as we collaborate to benefit a common cause. We hope that our volunteer-run initiative can play a role in transforming our student body into a more charitable community that can advocate for not just our own education, but the education of the millions of children without access to the education they need. Not only will you contribute to better education, but a better future. Besides helping our cause, our events will allow students to destress as they grab a treat, play games, or watch a movie during future fundraisers. Students will have various opportunities to socialize with friends and chat with new people, all while contributing to a powerful cause.
",@stuygivology,"
Our current leadership roles consist of the President, Vice President, Outreach Coordinator, and Events Coordinator. These roles will be chosen through an application and interview process. The Givology board members at that time will release an application form where possible candidates will apply and then the board members will choose specific candidates to interview and lastly pick out students to take on their respective leadership roles. Specific protocols that the President will follow will be overseeing the leadership team of the chapter, guiding the strategic direction and activities of the chapter, and acting as the Givology ambassador in school and in the community. The Vice President will support the President, manage outreach and recruiting events, mobilize students, and lead chapter initiatives. The Events Coordinator will hold and organize creative fundraising events on campus in support of Givology’s supported students and projects. The Outreach Coordinator will reach out to the high school about Givology and manage the chapter’s social media presence. If a leader violates school rules or creates an unwelcoming environment for other members, an anonymous vote will be held to decide if they will be impeached. Leaders are expected to follow procedures accordingly.
","At Stuyvesant, we have more than one volunteering club, but we have a defined focus: on education, the future of our younger generation. We hope to create not just a fundraising club, but rather, a community of advocates that can constantly learn from each other and strive for more effective fundraising. Givology’s commitment to maximizing the impact of every dollar to overcome this issue on an international scale allows us to stand out. Furthermore, learning can sometimes be seen as tiring or bothersome to some, but at StuyGivology, we acknowledge how privileged we are to have the opportunities we have and fight education inequality so more can have such opportunities. We’re able to hold fundraisers and volunteering opportunities with grassroots organizations Givology is partnered with. These organizations are often overlooked because the impact is local, but these organizations deserve just as much support as larger ones. Givology’s years of experience and history of both donor transparency and dedication to serving underprivileged students will allow us to better understand how to fundraise and advocate for equality in education. 

","More frequent meetings will take place around and after events for event planning. However, there will be mandatory meetings at least once a month.",['tuesday'],low,"['givology', 'volunteer', 'education']","

Stuyvesant Board Games Club,stuybgc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuybgc/e87ee181,The Stuyvesant Board Games Club is dedicated to the playing and teaching of a wide range of board and tabletop games.,"The Stuyvesant Board Games Club is dedicated to the playing and teaching of a wide range of board and tabletop games. Some examples include Splendor, Quantum and Coup. The club meets every Tuesday and Friday to play these and other games, using them as a way to relax and interact after the stress of the school week. The extreme stress that Stuyvesant students sometimes find themselves under makes this a key role of the club. The club is also dedicated to providing a welcoming space for all students; it accepts all members of the student body and has no commitment requirements. The club also aims to expand awareness and knowledge of board and tabletop games by teaching them to new members, and by allowing members to bring in their own games and teach them to the rest of the club. This allows the club to expand its knowledge over time as members learn how to play more and more games from one another.","The club works to benefit the Stuyvesant community in three main ways. First, it provides a place for students to relax and de-stress after a long week of work. This is highly important as the environment of Stuyvesant can be both emotionally and physically debilitating, and periods of relaxation like those provided by the club’s weekly meetings are necessary to maintain the health of the school’s students. Second, the club provides a place for people who are interested in board and tabletop games to find others who share their interests, and to play with those people. The Stuyvesant Board Games Club owns not just mainstream, run-of-the-mill board games, but also more niche games that a person with a particular interest in board or tabletop games might be interested in. Third, since games of the type typically played here require several people, the Stuyvesant Board Games Club welcomes anyone who, whether new to Stuyvesant or not, is looking for a fun way to interact with the community and make new friends, in or outside of their grade. 

Overall, StuyBGC is a club that welcomes anyone and everyone. It is a very laid-back club, and is a great place for board game enthusiasts, people looking to join a club and make new friends, and everyone else, really. ",https://discord.gg/Ndk3D64MnH,"There is a minimum of two leadership positions in the Stuyvesant Board Games Club. These consist of one president and one or more vice-presidents. Each spring, the president(s) for the next school year are chosen by a ranked-choice vote by the active members of the club. Active members are members who attend at least eight meetings after January 1. Members must announce their candidacy on May 1st and all votes must be cast by May 31st. Leadership may choose to veto any candidates they feel would not be fit to serve in club leadership. Second place in the votes wins the vice president's office.

Leadership may choose to delegate certain responsibilities in club management (e.g. making sure that the room is kept tidy during a meeting) to other members known as secretaries. These positions may be given or revoked at any time with a given reason and with a vote between the president and vice president. They do not count as leadership for the purposes of other mentions to leadership in this club, unless otherwise specified.

Leadership may be impeached if any member of the club requests a vote to do so, explaining why the leader(s) should be removed. If more than two-thirds of the club's active members agree (if this occurs in fall, active-members count as anyone who has attended at least 6 meetings), the parties being impeached will be removed and replaced by a ranked-choice election that lasts one week; the candidates with the most and second-most votes become president and vice-president respectively. There is no limit on the length of time an official may serve as long as they are reelected.","Our members are very dedicated to the point where the club meets voluntarily outside of scheduled school days. This allows the community to accommodate alumni members, longer events such as Tabletop Role Playing Game Sessions, and non-Stuyvesant guests. We work to foster creativity and leadership skills, while providing a place for students to relax, unwind, and enjoy board games. Because of the ability to play board games online, we can also meet when there is inclement weather or scenarios that would prevent clubs from meeting in person. Our club goes beyond Stuyvesant. Although it starts there, it is a community of its own.","We meet Tuesdays and Fridays throughout the year. If we are off from school on those days, we may reschedule meetings to the nearest available date. Meetings will always be held on Fridays, Tuesday is subject to change as we observe club attendance. If attendance is low on Tuesdays, we might call off Tuesday meetings or pick a different day to hold meetings depending on our club members' availability. 

Online meetings may occur based on leadership discretion.","['tuesday', 'friday']",low,"['board', 'game', 'bgc']","Join the board games club! We do fun tabletop games and are willing to teach.

Stuyvesant Science Olympiad,stuyoly,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyoly/f2450ac4,"We explore and strive to excel in a variety of disciplines in the realm of science through learning and competition!
","Stuyvesant Science Olympiad is a team that prepares members to compete in annual inter-school competitions on a regional, state, and national level. From performing chemistry labs to building bridges, there are a total of 23 events that members can choose to develop themselves in. 

At Stuy, we divide the events into five fields of science: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science, and Technology/Engineering. 
The Stuyvesant Science Olympiad Team works to prepare its members to not only achieve prestige and medal places during competition, but also for them to explore and discover more about their passions in the sciences. Stuyvesant Science Olympiad competed in invitationals at MIT, UPenn, Yale, Cornell, etc. These competitions give students the opportunity to visit college campuses and also see the extensive community Science Olympiad has ranging from middle school students to undergrad and graduate students. 

Stuyvesant’s team is almost entirely student operated; veterans of the competition teach newcomers events on a weekly basis. All members are expected to have hands-on experience in their learning, gaining skills that are transferable to the classroom. 
For more information on events and science olympiad please read at https://soinc.org/","Besides aiming to come out on top during competition season (current goal: making it to Nationals!), the Stuy Scioly Team hopes to encourage an air of camaraderie and teamwork among its competitors and a passion to learn and discover more about the sciences. 

Although we may be considered high commitment, we are not cutthroat. At the end of the day, the reason for sending our members to compete is so that they can better themselves not only as students, but as scientists and teammates. Every meeting has the inherent purpose of teaching the members about interesting scientific topics and processes and having them work together with their competition partners in studying/building/experimenting. This is done so that they will be driven to chase subjects that interest them, and develop closer ties and improve their communication and problem solving skills with their teammates.

These students mature and develop from students into teachers, leaders, and scholars. It is in our sincerest hope that the qualities they gain from their time with us are spread around and diffuse to students outside the team as well. Stuy Scioly has long stood for a willingness to learn and a triumph of teamwork , and will continue to stand for bestowing these qualities onto its members. ",@stuyscienceolympiad,"Appointment:
There are around 14 student leadership positions in the team: 1 to 2 captains for each of the 5 divisions, a President and Vice President, a treasurer, a secretary, and a team coordinator. Every year, the leaders meet together to choose new admins to fill in the roles of the team's graduating leaders. Applications are released to existing members, interviews are conducted, elections are held, and new leaders are voted by the previous ones.

Usually, leadership is reserved for upperclassman and veteran members. Existing positions are held from year to year given that the leader has shown sufficient commitment and dedication to the team. The council of existing admins, as well as Ms. Fong, are responsible for the selection of future admins, voting to decide. 

The VP is selected as a sophomore, learns management from the President during their junior year, and graduates to Presidency for their senior year. The Captains may be selected at any point in their Science Olympiad careers, given that they have shown leadership and mastery throughout the competition season and their application process. Treasurers and Secretaries are selected similarly to captains, based on their abilities to handle the team's finances and various forms and information.

Impeachment:
Should the case arise that members or fellow admins of the team find that an admin is not performing his/her given duties correctly, they must email the team about the issue. After validating the problem by means of multiple testimonies and evidence, a meeting of admins will be held to discuss the lack of responsibility and propose ways the admin could address this. The second time in the school year that the issue is brought up, a vote will be held by the other admins on whether to relieve admin of interest of his/her duties.

If approximately 2/3rds of the admins (9/14) find the leader guilty of a continued lack of responsibility (or history of wrongdoings) to the team, along with an authorization by the team supervisor, Ms. Fong, the admin will be relieved of his/her position and an emergency election form will be released shortly after for other members to fill in the role. 
","Stuyvesant Science Olympiad is one of the only places students can explore their love and passion for science in a wide spectrum. From hands on activities such as chem lab and bridges, to studying circuits and human anatomy
We engage in competition in various events across many scientific disciplines, including Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Physics and Technology - but our team is beyond just a mere union of students. Stuy SciOly is a family composed of unique and talented individuals, ranging from aspiring artists to future politicians, united by both the drive of competition and our emotional and personal struggles.
From testing powders in the Advanced Chemistry Lab to guessing the number of dropping duct tape parachutes; from racing cardboard kayaks laminated with packaging tape across the river to sampling gas stations snacks on the coach, the members of Science Olympiad have molded the club into a sanctuary from the hardships and obstacles that we all share.
While Science Olympiad provides us with an intense, immersive experience in science, strengthening our characters and inspiring persistence, it also serves as a powerful catalyst for our mental, social, and emotional development, creating memories and bonds that will last a lifetime.

We aim to cover a complete group performance, which is singing+dancing, every two months; it will later either be uploaded to social platforms or be performed live. We will decide on the performing song by providing several songs to the members, and then members can choose one of them by voting; members could suggest the song. Members can choose whether they want to be in singing, dancing, or singing+dancing; each member will get their specific part of singing or dancing. Before teaching, members are expected to be familiar with the music, and the members who want to sing should be familiar with their lyrics. The Singing Director will teach the singing techniques and help the members improve, and the Dancing Director will teach the choreo. After practices, all members will group up together to complete the performance.","Chinese Music Club, or CMC, provides students who love singing and dancing the opportunity to shine on the stage.

Chinese Music Club also provides a chill and loving environment for all the students in Stuyvesant, giving them space to relax by singing out loud or dancing expressively. We will also hold Karaoke or Talent show nights to relax and enjoy the happiness of music. Furthermore, music is also the best tool to promote the culture. People from all different backgrounds are welcome to join! In the practice of singing and dancing Chinese music, the members are able to learn more about Chinese culture—the history, the language, the outfit, etc. Our social media—Facebook, Instagram, WeChat, and Discord—allows all members to chat and post anything that relates to Chinese music, which helps people to socialize with one who shares a common hobby and interest. As the hatred toward Chinese and Asain keeps increasing, we hope, in our effort, we can give confidence and courage to all the Chinese, ABCs, and Asians within our touch and bring our community love and joy.

","StuyAquatics strives for students to explore the aquarium hobby while also amassing a deeper understanding of various freshwater aquatic species, their required care, and the attributes that they possess. This club also aims to teach students about the various environmental requirements and processes that go into maintaining a healthy, stable aquarium.

StuyAquatics plans to unify anyone from those who seek a career in aquatic-related studies to casual hobbyists who just like looking at fish.

Members may attend meetings at their leisure, and can even choose to take home any specimens (e.g plant cuttings, fish, snails) that are available. Types of meetings will range from informational presentations to documentary nights to build-your-own-jar meetings, where members can build their own aquarium jars.","Getting one’s feet wet in fishkeeping may be daunting at first, but StuyAquatics provides guidance and vital resources that are hard to come by for beginner aquarists. StuyAquatics aims to introduce guidelines and tips that students can apply to their own aquariums while advising against common misconceptions that often ail beginner hobbyists. Students will be able to diagnose diseases and funguses that a fish or other aquatic life can contract. Students will also be able to identify symptoms of poor water quality, bacterial blooms, low or high humidity, and fluctuating water parameters in their enclosed ecosystems. By doing so, StuyAquatics aims to lessen the maltreatment and abuse of common aquatic species and bring out their true colors. Without StuyAquarists, students have a very difficult time meeting up face-to-face with those who share their interests in fishkeeping, as the criteria real-life aquarium clubs have can be hard to participate in for a busy Stuyvesant student.

The club is open to suggestions from members as to what types of speakers they are looking for and what activities they are interested in participating in.

StuySquad!,stuysquad,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuysquad/ec2a371e,Stuy Squad aspires to promote a love for dance within the Stuyvesant community through a myriad of dance styles.,"Stuy Squad consists of approximately fifteen crews split into ten different dance styles depending on the year, all of which perform in an annual showcase at the close of each semester. In addition to fostering and strengthening a cohesive dance community at Stuyvesant, Stuy Squad also serves to bring together a variety of students of different grades and backgrounds to work towards a common goal — putting together the best showcase yet. Commitment to the club depends upon the crew and how many crews a student is participating in. Most crews practice around two or three times a week, however, this typically increases to five times a week as the show grows nearer. Weekend practices do not occur unless they are studio practices. Universally, the Stuy Squad board asks that each member of Stuy Squad is not absent from rehearsal more than five times, as it can infringe upon performance quality.","Stuy Squad as a whole will ultimately create closer connections between dancers in the same crews, shed light upon the thriving dance culture Stuyvesant has, and highlight the artistic talent present in the student body. Stuyvesant is typically characterized as a rigorous and competitive school that values academic performance above all else; however, along with many other clubs, Stuy Squad serves to contradict that assumption. Stuy Squad aims to showcase the talent that many might predict to be missing from a school of such high academic rigor. Stuy Squad is also a chance for students to take a breather in their busy lives and focus on their passion. It is quite easy for a student to devote all their time to academics because of the school’s focus, and Stuy Squad hopes to serve as an outlet for both the dancers as well as the audience to forget about their stress and simply enjoy the world of dance. Meeting new students through dance crews is also a valuable experience, from not only reaching out to individuals that one would’ve never had the chance to talk to, but also bonding through a shared passion. Our crews, spending countless hours of practice together, ultimately bond and create a large, welcoming community of dancers. ",@stuysquad,"There are two main areas of leadership within Stuy Squad: the board and directorship. To be a board member, students are asked to complete a written application and an interview (either in person or over Zoom). Regarding directorship, students are asked to complete a slightly shorter written application and an in-person interview. Prepared choreography is a requirement for both sections of the application process.

Impeachment of board members can only occur if there is an explicitly given complaint about the student in question that is deemed harmful enough to the future of Stuy Squad to warrant consideration for removing that person from the board. However, because board members are specifically chosen for their commitment to Stuy Squad and their ability to make fair decisions, the prospect of impeachment for any reason is extremely unlikely and unprecedented.

As for impeachment of directors, if it is found that a director is not behaving properly, the misconduct can be communicated to the Stuy Squad board, which will then review whether or not that director should be removed from power. ","Stuy Squad is the largest and sole dance-only performance during the Stuyvesant academic year. While other shows and performances throughout the school year implement dance as a minor aspect, Stuy Squad makes dance the sole focus. It focuses on celebrating each individual dance style instead of forcing conformity upon students. Our crew members also make use of outside studios and practices, something that no other club experiences regularly. This is, of course, decided through the individual crews and their directors, but many of Stuy Squad’s groups aspire to give a high-quality and entertaining performance to the audience.

Stuy FFAC aims to further this mission at Stuyvesant High School by spreading awareness about the consequences of industrial animal agriculture, including but not limited to the ethical, environmental, and health impacts, and by making plant-based eating more accessible to Stuyvesant students. Stuy FFAC strives to accomplish this through having members engage in documentary screenings and discussions. Members will also participate in presentations, campaigns, events, and other project work. Past presentations have taken place both in and outside of Stuyvesant High School, and past events have included conferences and a cooking master class. Stuy FFAC also has several teams for members to do additional work in: Green Garnish (our plant-based cooking publication) and the Outreach Team (which includes the Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube committees).","Not many Stuyvesant students are aware of the vast impact that they could have by creating shifts in their diet, and this is something that Stuy FFAC hopes to change. Increasing awareness about the ethical, environmental, and health consequences of what students eat can empower students to make adjustments to their plates for their own benefit and for that of the animals and environment around them. Stuy FFAC hopes to open a conversation about the impact that simply being a reducetarian can have, and making all students feel comfortable speaking on industrial animal agriculture, its impacts, and solutions. Stuy FFAC also takes a holistic look at factory farming, training members to think more interdisciplinarily and to consider how various fields of activism overlap. For example, the human rights abuses rampant in industrial animal agriculture are often unknown, and bringing such issues to light better informs members' activism. The projects and team work that members engage in also hone various important skills, including event organizing, communication, public speaking, graphic design, and more. These skillsets not only create better activists but also better prepare members for work in the professional environment. Furthermore, Stuy FFAC is a community. Stuy FFAC hosts movie nights and game nights various times throughout the year, providing a place for students to not just engage in activism but also develop friendships.""Members are expected to attend at least 75% of meetings to receive a confirmation of service hours at the end of the service year.",https://sites.google.com/view/stuyffac/home?authuser=0,"Members are expected to attend at least 75% of meetings to receive a confirmation of service hours at the end of the service year.

Media can include videos, images, sound clips, video games, movies, short films, and simulations. Each medium will be discussed and analyzed by members, ultimately forming a theory for it. Members can share their own findings or offer to explain a niche of horror that they have found. Leaders will offer lectures on aspects like suspense and the effect of imagery, along with examples via videos. YouTube channels will be the primary source of horror media and be anywhere between 2 and 20 minutes long. Meetings will include reacting to a video, analyzing segments, naming aspects of horror, breaking down what makes it initially scary, and then possible theories. Videos will also be watched in chronological order, so members can be fully immersed in the storyline presented. Due to the laid-back nature of this club, there are no requirements for members during or outside of meetings, other than to occasionally attend. ","The Horror Media Club can greatly benefit the Stuyvesant community because it is one of a kind. It brings a whole new aspect of media to the multitudes of clubs already in Stuyvesant and invites students to explore niches they never thought or knew of beforehand. Analyzing horror media can bring together students in their theory-making and create lasting friendships through a common interest. This club is a very open minded space for anyone, due to the bizarre nature of the media being observed. Students can elaborate on their wildest theories without judgement and encourage their peers to also let go of reality a little bit. Stuyvesant students need some creepy surrealism in their lives in order to get away from the stress of their school load. Furthermore, the horror community is growing in internet popularity and the Stuyvesant community can benefit from this surge in popularity by being aware of the current rising channels. Even if members do not stick around for every meeting, they will have wild stories of beasts and creepy shadow figures to tell their friends and elicit some shocked responses.

Positions are appointed via dedication to the club. Current leaders will evaluate the participation of members; to be considered for a leadership position, a member must attend a minimum of 6 meetings and have a voice in discussions. A Google Form will be sent for the application process and filled out by the applicant; the form will ask for their qualifications, reason for wanting the position, and what they plan to do as a leader of the club. If the current leaders are seniors, then they will make plans with the prospective leaders in order to ensure that the club maintains a presence and the mission. Leaders should have a prominent understanding of horror media and be prepared to lead lectures/discussions of the material. If they do not have this foundation, the current leaders will educate them until the transference of leadership. If leaders fail to fulfill their responsibilities, they will be impeached.

The club is focused on creating an album by the end of the year featuring all of the members of the club, which is uploaded to Spotify and other major streaming services. Members of the club are expected to work together to create tracks for the album, but the club is also a fantastic place for students to get help with producing their own music.

Many students at Stuyvesant play at least one instrument but often do not have an outlet for them to perform. SMPC allows for kids to learn digital music production to create their own music to share with the world, which can foster individual artistry. Collaborating in the SMPC lets students learn how to write lyrics, compose melodies, and program drums from their peers and pick up a greater understanding of music theory. A diverse collection of artists creates a space for students to be exposed to genres and production methods they may have been unfamiliar with. With competent executive producers (the president/co-presidents) who are able to mix and master students' tracks, artists at Stuyvesant can get a start in their career without needing to pay for expensive equipment or production courses.

Stuyvesant Students Demand Action,stuystudentsdemandaction,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuystudentsdemandaction/d29576f9,"Stuy SDA is a chapter of the national gun violence prevention organization, Everytown for Gun Safety. ","Every day, more than 110 Americans are killed with guns. The gun violence crisis is a public health crisis, and Stuyvesant Students Demand Action focuses on mitigating the causes and effects of gun violence. Partnered with Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, StuySDA is able to connect to a nationwide organization focused on evidence-based solutions and common sense gun safety policies. As a club, members learn about instances of gun violence with accurate statistics and stories from families and survivors. This research is followed up by meaningful discussions. As a generation deeply impacted by this crisis, StuySDA emphasizes the importance of processing the emotions and fears regarding gun violence that impact the student body. StuySDA takes action by advocating for common-sense gun safety laws through phone banking and canvassing as well as registering voters. The club also focuses on educating the Stuyvesant community and working on initiatives to help those affected by gun violence such as fundraisers and donation drives.","Creating a Stuyvesant branch of Students Demand Action would enrich our student community in many ways. First, biweekly meetings of StuySDA will raise awareness about school shootings around the country as well as gun control legislation and action. This deeper level of scholarship about current events and strategies for mitigating gun violence will, in effect, help Stuyvesant students learn how to advocate for their own safety. Along with making change, the club will strive to understand the gun crisis on a deeper level. Through a historical lens, members will understand how America ended up in this position, and how other social systems continue to intersect with gun-related violence. The club will provide a safe space for discussion and healing in a generation so heartbroken by gun-related deaths and scared for its own future. It should be noted, though, that StuySDA does not claim to be able to provide counseling, and the club will continue to remind students to turn to Stuyvesant's guidance department for support. Through discussion, StuySDA also hopes to help the student body gain empathy for the victims of gun violence and their families, so the Stuyvesant community can avoid becoming desensitized to the issue. StuySDA will not just benefit the Stuyvesant community, though; it will also enhance an already successful movement of teenagers around the country. This sense of mutually supporting and being supported by a wide body of students passionate about gun reform will enhance and expand the Stuyvesant world.","@stuystudentsdemandaction, @studentsdemand, https://studentsdemandaction.org/","Club leadership will definitely include group leads, who will connect leaders with upcoming trainings, identify and recruit diverse leaders, coordinate with Moms Demand Action Chapter and the Students Demand Action Liaison, set the agenda and facilitate meetings, and collaborate with other leads to plan out goals/action items. Depending on how large the club grows and how manageable work is for club leaders, the club can include up to eight more central leadership roles. A Communications Lead would empower students to access media trainings to elevate their stories as they see fit, particularly those who have been disproportionately impacted by gun violence, represent the group at public events and media interviews, coordinate with Everytown’s communications team to identify events to advise to the media, and support legislative work by coordinating Letters to the Editor and Op-eds. A Resource Lead would manage recruitment tools (peer to peer texts, emails, phone banks) and develop a working knowledge of platforms such as GSUo, VAN (provided by the organization). An Events lead would plan, track, and oversee all group events, coordinate with Everytown staff to secure meeting venues, track attendance at events, and work with Resource Lead, Membership Lead and Treasurer to recruit for events and ensure the event is within budget parameters. A Social lead would create content for social media, like graphic design posters, Instagram Stories, Tweets, or TikToks to bring attention to local, statewide, and federal legislation, share calls to action, promote events, draw in new members, and elevate voices and stories in the group. Lastly, a Community Outreach lead would identify local partners to co-host or support events, perform outreach and lead communication with clubs and activist groups in the area, and thereby facilitate good relationships with community members and organizations. All members will have access to an anonymous form where they can report issues within the club and strike leaders if they do not perform their duties. If a leader is reported twice and at least two members of the leadership team agree, they may be impeached. After each year, the current group leads will review applications with a few essay questions that assess the position specific skills and the student’s knowledge about gun violence. The current leadership team will then pick the students most qualified and committed to the club for leadership positions.","StuySDA is unique, relevant, and new! Many clubs at Stuyvesant appeal to a small niche of kids on a specific life path. StuySDA will have a unique inclusivity. The gun crisis in America affects all of us, so StuySDA will be a safe space for any students interested. No prior knowledge or experience is required to show up to join the club. StuySDA also has the unique backing of a large and stable organization, Students Demand Action (Everytown For Gun Safety), which will provide the club with ample resources, guidance, funding, and most importantly, a network of clubs with which to collaborate to create a stronger impact. This will also be a way for Stuyvesant students to make connections with other students around the country interested in social advocacy.

We strive to advocate against the four central proponents of gun violence: gun glorification, political apathy, poverty, armed supremacy and America’s mental health crisis. Having to hear about new mass shootings, oftentimes in a school just like our own, creates an environment of fear and unrest that inhibits students from feeling safe.

-	Secretary: Secretaries will be responsible for taking minutes (notes and key points from each meeting) and sharing it with the rest of the leadership team. Appointment for this position is the same as the previous positions listed above. 
-	Publicity Officer: This position will require the individual to be responsible for the marketing aspect of the organization (such as catering to interested students at club fair, developing flyers for interested students, etc).

-	Members: Students who are interested in joining this organization can express their interest by filling out a form at club fair or simply reaching out to any of the leadership team. Any student passionate about developing professionally are welcome to join at any point during the school year (as the lesson plan for the week will change topics more frequently). Each member is expected to be on time, be attentive, and be active during each meeting. There will be occasional assignments and presentations that each member will be responsible for, and it will consist of the lessons learned from these meetings. If any member is falling behind and/or failing to complete their duties, they will be referred to the Vice-President for a brief meeting to discuss any club issues and their future in the organization.

","At Stuyvesant Bridging Seas, our goal is to connect high schoolers from around the world by creating a platform for them to learn about each other's cultures and unique experiences. We envision a more compassionate, understanding world where students embrace their roots and different lifestyles through direct communication with international friends. Stuyvesant Bridging Seas is a branch of Bridging Seas that will work with the outside organization to facilitate a pen pal program for Stuyvesant students. The program matches students of the same ethnicity in different countries to become pen pals. Members will be expected to attend group check-in meetings and events that are held every few weeks and penpal evaluation meetings with their pen pal and a director at least once a month to evaluate how their international friendships are going. They will also be expected to text their pen pals once a week and video call them twice a week.","Stuyvesant Bridging Seas will give members the opportunity to make friends from all different backgrounds. Many Stuyvesant students might feel distant from their culture and heritage because of growing up in America. However, through participating in Stuyvesant Bridging Seas’s pen pal program, students can feel closer to their heritage through the cultivation of friendships with people that share the same culture as them and learn about how those friends celebrate their shared heritage in different ways that they are used to. Ultimately, being a certain ethnicity in one country is different from being the same ethnicity in another. Stuyvesant Bridging Seas will increase tolerance among students who learn that people around the world are different and to celebrate those differences through their experiences with meeting new people that they would’ve never met without Stuyvesant Bridging Seas. Additionally, students will have an opportunity to practice learning a new language with their pen pal that will come from a different country. We currently offer Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Bengali, Korean, and Tamil, but we hope to expand to include more languages. A student can request for their pen pal to speak a certain language and for their conversations to be in a certain language so they can practice language learning. ",https://bridgingseas.com/,"The leadership positions include director of social media, director of outreach, and director of finance as well as many more. There will be an application process for those who want to be on the administrative end of the pen pal program. After applications are received, they will be reviewed and evaluated. Those who qualify will be asked for an interview. The best-suited applicants will be selected based on their interview and application. The directors are expected to follow the director guidelines outlined by the Bridging Seas organization which include attending all meetings, being active in group chats and private messages related to Bridging Seas within 48 hours of the messages being sent, and meeting assignment deadlines. Failure to meet the guidelines will result in strikes. After three strikes, there will be a vote by the board of directors on whether or not the student can keep their position. Leadership positions will be transferred through the years and there will be applications for occupied positions during a director’s senior year. 
","We are unique because there are currently no programs in Stuyvesant that connect students to other high schoolers from around the world. Students don’t have access to opportunities to meet new people outside of their social sphere, let alone outside of New York City. Stuyvesant Bridging Seas provides an interactive and tolerant environment to meet new people and learn about other cultures. Rather than learning about people from other countries from a textbook or learning another language in a classroom setting, students can do that naturally through speaking and making meaningful connections with others their age. 
","Directors meet once a week to plan events, pen pal meetings, and work on administrative tasks. General members meet once a month on varying days that conform to their schedule to attend Bridging Seas sponsored events and to have their pen pal evaluation. They will also need to text their penpal once a week and video call twice a week.","['wednesday', 'thursday']",low,"['bridgingseas', 'language', 'penpal']","Stuyvesant Bridging Seas is affiliated with the nonprofit organization, Bridging Seas.

StuyEmbr,stuyembr,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyembr/85b10659,"StuyEmbr aims to connect students through interest and enjoyment in embroidery in a fun, casual environment.
","StuyEmbr’s purpose is to provide participants with the opportunity to explore a new interest (embroidery) and make friends along the way! It also aims to bring a new art form to Stuyvesant and introduce members to a hobby they might not have tried otherwise. Members will be able to make art pieces, personalize their belongings (clothes, tote bags, etc.), and even make gifts with just needle and thread. They will be able to express themselves in a new way or just enjoy the experience and de-stress! Members are not required to have any prior experience or be of a high skill level; beginners who show an interest will be able to learn along the way. Members will work on their own projects/designs and even collaborate with others if they want to. Since this is not a high-commitment club, members are free to join whenever they can/want to and just focus on having fun!
","Embroidery can serve as an opportunity for students to escape from stress in their school and personal lives, as well as gain a new skill set! It’s a well-known fact that Stuy students often get a lot of work which can be very stressful. Embroidering while talking with friends or listening to music can help students take their minds off of things. It will also bring a new art form to Stuyvesant and foster a new community around the interest, allowing students with similar interests to connect and make new friends. Students will also be able to demonstrate their creativity and express themselves in a new way by creating new embroidery designs and decorating/personalizing their belongings if they so choose. Students can even make gifts for friends, family members, or special events and holidays! Some may discover an interest they never knew they had or finally get the opportunity to explore a long-awaited hobby. 
Embroidery is a very handy skill to have! To elaborate, you can use it to make patches, give old or plain clothes a new look with a favorite character, pattern, or quote, and even cover up any stains or small holes you’d like to hide on your belongings. Can’t afford that really cool graphic sweatshirt? Can’t find any merchandise for your favorite character? Can’t figure out any cool gifts for a special occasion? Just embroider something! It’s a very useful skill to have and there’s no harm in learning a little :) 
For people who have always had an interest in it but had no idea where to start, we can also provide instruction, guidance, and tips! We welcome everyone, no matter their skill level or previous experience. 
",,"Leadership positions are Leaders and Co-leaders. 
Board members will be chosen through an application process, including a google form and interview. Filling empty seats will be done by the current Leaders and Co-leaders. Current leaders/co-leaders will be able to maintain their current positions into the next school year, depending on performance. Current co-leaders may be able to apply for Leader when the position is open. Co-leaders are expected to assist the Leaders with overall management such as scheduling, outreach, budgeting, and inventory. 
A leadership position can be revoked for misconduct such as behavior that is discriminatory or makes fellow peers feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Leadership may also be revoked for failure to fulfill responsibilities. Members or board members can request an impeachment. A leader/co-leader may be impeached immediately depending on severity. Otherwise, a vote will be taken by members and board members. In the event of an impeachment, the position may be left unfilled until the following school year. If it is necessary to have a replacement, a Co-leader may be selected to replace the former Leader or members can run for the position of Leader or Co-leader.
","StuyEmbr will bring a new art form to the Stuyvesant Community, which has no other club based on embroidery. We offer a new way to express student creativity and members' personalities/interests with a hands-on craft that incorporates many other elements of art (designing, hand-eye coordination, etc.). They can incorporate basically anything they'd like to, ranging from favorite books to shows to music, and show off their work! Members will also have full creative control over their work (within guidelines) and whatever they make, with no expectation of skill level or prior experience!

Remote Buddies STUY,remotebuddiesstuy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/remotebuddiesstuy/2b243856,"RBS wants to give high schoolers the chance to gain mentoring experience, create bonds with younger students and earn official volunteer hours. ","Remote Buddies is a program that seeks to connect highschoolers with younger students (K-8). It is part of a non-profit organization called City Mission NYC, which provides official community service hours. At the moment, there are over 1500 participants and counting. To add on, there are eight existing leadership boards on the high school level: Hunter, Bronx Science, St. Paul’s, West End, Francis Lewis, Forest Hills, Brooklyn Tech, and Stuyvesant. 

Members will be paired up with K-8 students from all over New York City. They will meet on a platform of their choice (Zoom, Google Meets, Facetime etc.) for 30 minutes once a week at a minimum. Meeting dates and activities are flexible and can vary on a case to case basis. During these sessions, members and their mentees can decide on what they want to do. This can range from working on math problems, talking about history, playing musical instruments together, or just chatting about their interests and hobbies in general. Meetings within Stuyvesant will mainly be to make sure everyone is set up with a buddy and will serve as a common ground/touching point where leaders can check in and make sure everyone is doing well. Members who join Remote Buddies will essentially become a role model to their mentees. They can provide advice and answer questions that their mentees might have about their upcoming school years. Members can talk to their mentees about their experiences applying for different high schools or middle schools. They can also talk about what classes they took and what was challenging for them. 

In addition, members of the club and the program have other opportunities to contribute aside from being a mentor. Remote Buddies has various committees focusing on web development, event planning, newsletter, communications, social media, etc. giving members opportunities to pursue different interests. 
","Remote Buddies will be an extremely positive and beneficial experience for all people who participate. Remote Buddies provides an opportunity to get work/mentoring experience, which a lot of kids at Stuyvesant may not have had yet. Members will develop leadership and collaborative skills. They will gain meaningful experiences, knowing that they are helping younger students become the best versions of themselves. Thus, members themselves will also become the best versions of themselves. In addition, Stuyvesant High School’s mission statement is to continue and enhance the commitment of providing a symbol of excellence in education. Remote Buddies can further represent this mission, and spread it beyond Stuyvesant, as it is a city wide program. Using the skills retained whilst participating in Remote Buddies, members will become more comfortable working with their peers and communicating with their teachers therefore improving the whole Stuyvesant community. Additionally, Remote Buddies is a low commitment club, and can be used to release stress on one’s downtime. Meetings are fairly relaxed, and the ability to take some downtime whilst still earning volunteer hours will benefit members' mental health, and therefore their overall experience in Stuyvesant. Overall, Remote Buddies can suit and will be beneficial to anyone from Stuyvesants vast community.
",,"Currently the entire Remote Buddies program is led by two founders and the presidents in each chapter. As for Stuyvesant high school, applicants had filled out a google form to apply for the positions and went through an interview process. That form was reviewed by the Remote Buddies Board (based outside of Stuyvesant) and from the applicants, two co-presidents were selected. After the Remote Buddies Board selects the presidents, the presidents can open up board applications for positions within their school/chapter. Chapter board applications will be through google forms and an interview process as well. 

This process is repeated every year where the Remote Buddies Board will open up president applications for each chapter where applicants will fill out a google form and undergo an interview process. 

General protocol for members is pretty straightforward and similar to other low commitment clubs. Members are expected to show up to in school meetings, and put in the necessary work outside of those meetings (meetings with their buddies). Any club member that wants to become a leader (co-presidents and vice president) must first apply to the Remote Buddies Board and get approved.
","One way Remote Buddies is unique is because of the very strong foundation that it already has. Remote Buddies already has over 1500 members city wide, and is extended to nine high schools as a club. In addition, while other programs created during quarantine focused singularly on a tutoring aspect, Remote Buddies was created to form long lasting bonds between current high schoolers and K-8 students. Through Remote Buddies younger kids are able to connect with students in some of the top high schools in New York City and have meaningful experiences that will benefit their future. In addition, this program has already been going on for the past 2 years.

Students can learn to speak Ukrainian and learn about the Ukrainian history and heritage. Members can share personal experiences about traditions and customs, contributing anything from cuisine to folklore. We will celebrate holidays and traditions together, including having club dinners and potlucks. Members can also combine resources and share event information in relation to fundraisers, volunteering opportunities, and anti-war protests. We will invite speakers, go on trips, and attend events outside of school together. By holding these events, trips, and meetings, we hope to help members discover a deeper connection to their identity, forge friendships with fellow students, and show support for Ukrainian local businesses, Ukrainian refugees, and for one's homeland in times of crisis. We seek to provide a safe space where Ukrainian students can unite, where students can learn about Ukrainian culture and current events, and where newfound friends can support each other and Ukrainian communities not only in Stuyvesant, but throughout NYC.","This activity will provide students of all backgrounds with resources to learn about Ukrainian values and culture. We hope that students can connect over food, conversation, or simply have something to look forward to during their week. Whether we are supporting local businesses or fundraising aid for Ukrainian refugees, club members will always feel welcome to join. Ukrainian culture is not heavily taught in classrooms, so this club aims to diversify students’ education on current events and Ukraine’s rich history. We will hold casual discussions over Ukrainian snacks and tea to help students relax after their long day of classes. Stuy students can relate to each other over shared experiences of their family, culture, and language. By creating this community, we encourage members to learn more about themselves and their peers. Stuyvesant required courses may be more rigorous than our lessons, but we will make sure that students walk out of our meetings/events with newfound pride and knowledge. Due to our club being low commitment, members don’t have to stress over missing any lessons or meetings, as we encourage all students to join! Special meetings will be held for major Ukrainian celebrations including Rizdvo, Easter, Victory Day, and Ukrainian Independence Day. Overall, the primary focus of this club will be to provide education and fun!

Club members are encouraged to attend meetings as often as convenient, and to check the socials rather frequently to keep up with club plans. Otherwise, members of this club will have a lot of power in terms of suggesting activities, contributing to discussions, and evaluating and voting for leaders. Leaders will be elected according to involvement and contribution to the club. Senior leaders will hold the position until they graduate, at which point they are succeeded by the vice presidents (the only exception to this pattern is if a leader steps down or is impeached). A leader may be impeached if members of the club find them ill-fit for running the club such as being disorganized, disrespectful, and not communicating well with members of the club. If a member brings forth a vote to impeach a leader (with valid reason), the majority rules. The duties of the senior leaders include organizing club events, communicating with members and faculty, collaborating with community leaders outside of Stuy, and hosting meetings 3 times a month. As the leading positions become more specialized as new supporting leaders are elected, responsibilities may change.","Our club will not only be a place of education, but also of activism and community intended to support the local Ukrainian community. Expanding beyond the Stuyvesant building, club members will be able to explore Ukrainian heritage regardless of their backgrounds. Club members can share resources for volunteering, fundraising and contributing to aid organizations for the current crisis. As our club grows so will our members knowledge of Ukrainian identity and traditions. Despite sharing culture and folklore, authentically celebrating little-known Ukrainian holidays, and taking trips to centers of culture, students in this club will encounter new friends and a community that can always educate, inspire, and empower.

StuyFS,stuyfs,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyfs/b402c245,StuyFS is a club centered around teaching people the basics of full-stack web development.,"StuyFS was created to serve as a bridge between Stuy's computer science community and the world of full-stack development. As such, anyone from any skill level is allowed to join! Whether you're Joma Tech in training or Fred Flinstone, there's a place for you here as long as you're willing to learn. First, members will gain a core understanding of Frontend development, gaining familiarity in areas such as JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS. This will be done via guided lessons and Code-Alongs, which are engaging mini lessons that conclude with students using what they've learned to create anything they'd like. For those interested in challenging themselves, we also have a plethora of side projects anyone can start at any time. Then, once members are confident in their frontend skills, we will move to Backend development. This will center around Golang, C++, and MongoDB, and will have a heavier emphasis on projects than on Frontend development. Members are also expected to treat each other with respect, as this field isn't easy. If you see someone struggling, help them out! It helps build a community we can be proud of :).","The goal of StuyFS is to serve as the greatest possible introduction to Fullstack development you could ask for. Fullstack is notorious for being one of the most challenging CS-related fields to break into, as it requires you to master both Front-end and Back-end development. Unfortunately, this high barrier of entry causes many people to shy away from the field, instead opting to hone their skills in one specific area. It shouldn’t be that way. That’s where StuyFS comes in. From highly detailed lessons to fun projects meant to test your abilities, we hope that we can both create a tight-knit CS community and help more people become Fullstack devs. Furthermore, the skills taught in this club are applicable in the real world. As Full-stack development encompasses both Front-end and Backend web development, mastering the curriculum is synonymous with acquiring an extraordinarily marketable skillset usable in the workplace. For the first semester, essential Front-end languages such as Javascript, CSS, and HTML will be covered. We’ll also teach you how to use a few popular JS libraries, such as jQuery and ReactJS. For the second semester, on the other hand, we’ll be reviewing backend material relating to MongoDB, Golang, and C++. Because each and every one of these languages is extremely useful at the highest levels (including companies such as Google and Uber!), Knowing your way around them will undoubtedly help out for internships and other job opportunities.",@stuyfullstack https://www.instagram.com/stuyfullstack/,"As StuyFS is a newer club, the available leadership positions are currently limited to President and Vice President. There can be up to two Vice Presidents at once, and Co-Presidents can be elected if needed. Around the end of each school year, the leadership team will send out an application on google forms. Members interested in obtaining a leadership position should fill out this form, explaining why they deserve the spot. After a certain amount of time, the current leadership team will hold an election in order to determine the incoming leaders. These new leaders will be chosen based on availability, dedication to the club, leadership skills, and mastery of the StuyFS curriculum. In the case of an FS leader not doing what they’re supposed to or abusing their power, a group discussion will be held where all members, regardless of status, can voice their thoughts on the situation at hand.","Our organization is unique for many reasons. The first of which is that this club's curriculum will help you immensely should you choose to pursue computer science as a career. The skills taught in this club are so valuable that learning them right now puts you WAY ahead of the curve and can even make it easier to land internships. The second reason why StuyFS is unique is that no other computer science club has the same scope as us. In addition to being the only full-stack club at Stuyvesant, we are also planning to teach our members six highly valuable languages over the course of the school year, whereas others mainly cover one.","Meetings will be held every Thursday, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

The club will give students more opportunities to work hands-on in helping the animal community- even meeting them personally while volunteering at animal shelters. SAA is interested in creating a space where students can learn more about different animals and the issues impacting them in our local communities. General members are expected to attend monthly meetings where there will be a focus on a specific animal, as well as participate in fundraising efforts related to that animal directed to local charities and funds. Members will also be encouraged to volunteer at our partnering shelters, and attend fundraisers/other events inside and outside of school. By doing this, members will be able to develop their character as they become more compassionate about animals and volunteering. Overall, our club hopes to make an impact not only on the people around us but also on the animals in our communities. 
","The Stuyvesant Animal Association club will be one of the many clubs Stuy students can turn to after a long day of work. Out of the many de-stressing clubs Stuyvesant has, SAA is unique in how we focus on the importance of all animals, and we work to teach this importance and to help uphold how important it is for these animals to thrive. Through our biweekly meetings, and weekend activities, members of this club grow to appreciate every living creature, and we work to emphasize what change means and how anyone can help prevent negative change. SAA strives to change the mindset of Stuyvesant students; this club focuses on the little things in life- and how important it can be to maintain a balance. Through discussions of a certain animal and the possibilities of endangerment, as well as through volunteer work and hosting fundraisers, we teach students to be more open-minded and supportive of animals. This club will work closely with a small number of shelters to donate to and really connect with them as well as help them increase their adoption rate. In doing so we demonstrate how as a club, we can make a strong impact in the world. We also discuss the importance of others’ lives and we teach different sets of skills as well. Members will be more knowledgeable about animals in general, and they will grow to be more social and comfortable with working with others. Volunteering at shelters as well as running fundraisers will provide such opportunities as members will get close to not only animals but other people too. SAA is a club students can learn more from as they enjoy group activities and bond.",https://www.instagram.com/stuyanimalassociation/,"The leadership positions will include a president and vice president (or co-vice presidents). Not having specific leadership positions (as of now) will allow the club to be much more productive as a result of a group effort. This will also allow for each leader to be very involved in the details of the club, which will require active participation on their part. Impeachment will occur if a leader does not commit to his/her share of work and is not inclusive of all members of the club. This process must be agreed to by all the leaders of the club at the time. Leadership will remain the same through the years until graduation unless a leader wishes to relinquish their position. After that, members can fill out an Animal Association Board Application to be considered; the leaders will also take into account how dedicated and passionate members have been about the club's cause, through attendance in meetings and meaningful efforts in events.","Although a wide range of interests is expressed in Stuyvesant’s student body of over 3,000 students, there has yet to be a club that centers around serving animals, despite their playing such an integral role in our daily lives. This is where the Stuyvesant Animal Association comes into place. We are working to change this by creating an open space for all animal lovers (Who doesn’t love animals?) in Stuyvesant, promoting a widespread appreciation of all animals. This is what makes our organization so unique, and we believe the message will resonate with other students within the community.

It's a burgeoning functional language that's especially strong for web development and distributed systems. Discord and Pinterest run on elixir! Elixir has a sleek syntax with pattern-matching (even on function heads!) and guards (conditions for matches on function heads). Those allow for expressive code using multimethods over polymorphism, where instead of overriding and inheritance, we overload the function to take different data classes. Being a functional language, elixir has immutable objects, which are great because mutability can be hard to debug, especially when everything is concurrent. Its concurrency makes it a great candidate for backend development, but its utility in the frontend is growing. It's now totally possible to write full-stack websites in elixir. Members are expected to show up to meetings, but this club is pretty low commitment unless one collaborates on projects /w other people, in which case it's between one and their group.","The language is fairly recent, but its perks are slowly getting companies to switch to it. We believe Elixir is among the next generation of languages, including Python, Rust, and Julia, and is therefore worth having under the belt. Elixir isn't taught in Stuy, so it's worth studying a different language so one doesn't go over the same things twice. It's also a new perspective, because Stuyvesant's main CS class, APCS has its curriculum in Java, an object-oriented language. Functional programming isn't really taught at Stuy, and that's one of the reasons why we're here. There are many advantages that elixir has over other languages. Because everything runs in processes, you can build concurrent code to tackle various problems. Processes supervising each other also allow for code organization that's almost as good as that of the object-oriented languages. The language is extremely well-suited for web development (mostly backend), but frontend frameworks such as Phoenix LiveView are easy to integrate with existing React libraries and are slowly getting their own implementations. The other advantage of learning elixir is that its pattern-matching (especially when used recursively) results in cleaner code. It's also great for learning recursive patterns. And, all those skills persist in other languages.",https://discord.gg/v4XX8ZXAKC,"Leadership consists of a President and Vice president, but other roles may be added if necessary. The president and VP are expected to organize meetings and recruit members. Presidents will be elected at the end of each school year and will serve (along with their appointed roles) for the coming year. The president's vote in intra-leadership votes is worth 2 votes. Extra positions can be appointed by the presidents. Any intra-leadership majority vote, but not 75% supermajority will be left to referendum. Jurisdiction over the discord server will be passed on to the current presidents, with leadership alumni losing their administrator access and channels. In order to impeach someone in a leadership position, a referendum be held, with 2/3 (rounded up) of the members needing to vote yes in order for the person to be impeached. In the event of any ties, a runoff vote will be held. If it ends in a tie a semi-random lot will be used to settle it.

Join us to relax and learn with us the questions addressed and the answers proposed by Socrates, Aristotle, and Hobbes. We also will be studying game theory and its applications in today's world. The club is low commitment. Doing something you enjoy doesn't have to become bitter because of schedule conflicts or an off day. The club isn't a lecture, it is closer to a study group. Members are expected to join the discord, as it is the place where we will communicate outside of meetings and schedule future ones. We are all here to learn. We also are here to build around the tools people use to think. The project we are currently working on is a board game, and we hope to apply what we learn here to it.","There are numerous benefits to studying philosophy, such as learning to think critically and solve problems. Philosophy isn't taught in most schools, yet it is helpful to everyone. To fill in the gaps, we seek to create a club that fosters discussion of life's greatest questions. By studying game theory and philosophy, members are able to improve the connection between media and the viewer. For game design, game theory is important to predict how players play around chance and hidden information. In Literature and music, studying aesthetics helps create appealing content. It is also important for the club to be active outside of meetings. This is why the club's hub is its discord, as members spend more time away from meetings than on meetings, and can respond to conversations over a day. We hope to change the current opinion on philosophy since it feels like a relic of the past that one would only read in history books.

truecrime.stuy,truecrimestuy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/truecrimestuy/a7625d8b,truecrime.stuy is a club for all fellow true crime enthusiasts and those interested in the psychological makeup of criminals.,"Have you ever wondered what pushes people to do the unthinkable? Well, truecrime.stuy is a haven for anyone interested in anything true-crime related, whether it's the latest crimes, the most bizarre unsolved cases, or just in general, the psychological aspects behind criminology. Truecrime.stuy strives to create a welcoming environment for anyone who wants to get into true crime or is already interested in the fascinating topic. Even though true crime is gradually becoming more acceptable to chew over in society, students might not have many people to talk about it with, which is why truecrime.stuy is here for anyone wanting to discuss true crime freely with peers who think the same way. A new true crime story, case, or topic will be brought up and dissected once a week. Depending on availability, a new psychological condition that occurs as a byproduct of criminal interference will be discussed weekly/biweekly. Truecrime.stuy will also host a true-crime media night every month, where members will choose a true crime-related media piece for the club to watch and enjoy together, depending on availability. The club is open to any suggestions from students into consideration to ensure the best experience for everyone. Truecrime.stuy will discuss concepts such as criminology, criminal law, and forensics and bring in professionals from these fields to help students interested in pursuing crime-related jobs. Truecrime.stuy will also have its sights set on possibly having trips arranged for members to have a more extensive understanding of the field. Members will be encouraged but still have the choice to attend every week or not based on their availability and/or interest in a certain week's topic. Truecrime.stuy is a fun community open to everyone and hopes to shine a light on the true-crime job field. Although truecrime.stuy is lenient with missing meetings, we must have a valid reason for each absence. If a member misses more than three meetings with no excuse, they will be removed from the club. ","Truecrime.stuy is a safe place for anyone interested in true crime, psychology, or criminal law. The club allows each member to connect with others with similar interests and discover new passions. It will also serve as real experience for jobs dealing with the crime field. Skills, such as problem-solving and public speaking, will be touched upon throughout the club's weekly meetings, where discussion is encouraged among every one of its members. Students who may feel uncomfortable talking about their interests in the field will find comfort in this club that encourages those interested in true crime to share their thoughts and opinions on Ted Bundy, the Zodiac Killer, Elisa Lam, and many more! Students who are unsure of possible future career paths can receive a taste of what it's like to work in the crime field through professionals who will be invited to explain their typical workday and/or the impact their careers have on society. Members of this club will hone their critical thinking, logic, and problem-solving skills. Connections between Stuyvesant and the real world will be made when passionate speakers are brought in to talk about their careers. Truecrime.stuy also noticed that Stuyvesant doesn't have many crime-related electives/classes, such as criminology, and hopes to change that for the students looking to pursue a career in the crime field.",https://linktr.ee/truecrime.stuy,"Truecrime.stuy's leadership positions are appointed through a Google Forms application and after careful, unbiased consideration will have to participate in a short interview. Leaders are required to attend every meeting unless they have a valid excuse. Leaders are expected to contribute to the foundation of truecrime.stuy; this can include having suggestions and being open and ready for anything. Some specific but general protocols that all members have to follow are: being consistent with the meeting attendance, trying to participate in group discussions, and being respectful throughout the club's meetings. Leaders will lose their positions if they deign to participate and contribute to making materials for the club, do not attend meetings regularly, and are seen as being disrespectful to anyone, inside or outside of truecrime.stuy. Current leaders will appoint leaders together after one graduates. New leadership positions may open up throughout the school year if deemed necessary by the current leaders. ","	Truecrime.stuy is unique because it is the only club in Stuy that surrounds itself around everything relating to true crime and criminal law. Truecrime.stuy is an all-inclusive club that welcomes anyone and everyone, regardless of how new they may be to the subject. This club will help its members realize the importance of both the little details and the bigger picture in life, which is key to detectives investigating a crime. Truecrime.stuy is also a very ""domain-specific"" club, meaning that it mainly focuses on one topic or subject; this allows members to develop skills they won't necessarily gain access to and/or experience from in other clubs or situations. All members and their opinions are respected, as the club is a place for people to discuss their different perspectives on the controversial subject of true crime.

Inheriting a world of polarization, our community of 100,000 young people is committed to unifying across differences through our Gen Z Talk Show, ""POVz,"" our digital network on the Geneva app, and our text line. Breaking our echo chambers leads to a more unified world. The Stuyvesant chapter of this national organization will be primarily focused on online forum discussion as well as participating in open discussions about politics and the current global system we live in. Our goal is to break down the barriers between both sides of the aisle and increase effective communication between people of all belief systems. Another goal of The Conversationalist is to teach its members how to approach ideas and issues in our world with an objective mindset and thus think in a nonpartisan manner. ","Stuyvesant High School is home to more than three thousand students who all have differing ideologies. This organization offers a safe space where members can debate and share ideas on current events. We live in a world that has been connected in a manner that is almost instantaneous, by social media. Now more than ever it is important to acknowledge what happens beyond one's local community and be aware of the struggles present all around the world. Stuyvesant High School offers an elective class under Mr. Badgley on Geopolitics. This club aims to expand on those teachings and make those same opportunities available to everyone who is unable to take the class, due to its high demand. Unlike other open forum clubs at this school, this club is specifically nonpartisan and thus is open to hearing out ideas from all aspects of the political spectrum. Additionally, this club aims to teach its members how to analyze situations making them better prepared for the real world. Learning how to make clear and informed decisions, especially in today's society is an important skill to have. The forum style of engagement will also allow for flexibility as well as shareable experiences and learning moments, while also preparing members for college classroom settings. ",https://www.theconversationalist.com/,"Elections will be held to determine new leadership. The club will be run by a President and fellow appointed discussion/cabinet leaders. Members are expected to show up to at least four meetings a year and those holding leadership positions are expected to be responsive and communicative. If extra assistance is ever needed by the club leaders, applications for board positions will be sent out. Board positions include but are not limited to: supervision of social media, outreach, policy, and recruitment. Applicants will be interviewed and selected. For membership, everyone is free to join. Regarding impeachment protocols, an executive/club member must find an executive member guilty of an inappropriate, improper, or negligent action (ex: bullying, harassment, discrimination, long-term inactivity, etc.) and collect 15 signatures from active club members to initiate an impeachment hearing with the Student Union. The executive board and Student Union members will vote on the removal of the executive member, and a majority must be reached to do so. Further disciplinary action will be taken if necessary; the remaining executive may choose to replace the executive removed or eliminate the position.","Firstly, this club strives to have open forum-style discussions, mimicking college class settings, allowing us to create a unique engagement style. Secondly, this club is specifically nonpartisan and thus is open to hearing out ideas from all aspects of the political spectrum.

Stuy Assisting the Homeless Association (Stuy AHA),aha,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/aha/eb88ad48,Stuy A.H.A is a community where students work together to help the homeless and educate our community on the topic of homelessness.,"AHA aims to gather resources to help the homeless. As a club, we will plan and host fundraisers to raise money for shelters and reputable organizations that support the homeless. To add on, we hope to collect toiletries, hygiene products, and clothing for donations to homeless shelters. We will also work with trustworthy organizations to make and send care packages and hygiene kits to homeless people, which includes teens, families, women, etc. Before holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, we will have a meeting where members can write caring letters to be sent to homeless people. In addition, members will have the opportunity to volunteer at soup kitchens and/or shelters. Furthermore, we are aware that there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding homelessness. We hope to increase awareness and correct these misconceptions. In meetings, we will discuss various topics like how we can personally help. Our club’s activities will include creating posts and brochures to hand out to our family/friends regarding these myths and how each of us can be of aid. 
","In addition to benefiting homeless people through our volunteering and fundraising, Stuy A.H.A will provide education to Stuyvesant’s community about what being homeless truly means, just how prominent the problem is, and the best ways to help, both as a group, but also in one’s individual life and endeavors. The club aims to instill the idea that homeless people are still people, and that they deserve kindness and compassion.
Our low/medium commitment club meetings will be a safe, productive, and positive space where people can make friends, have fun, and share their own ideas, all while making a difference. Anyone is welcome, even if they can’t make it to every meeting or have only just decided to join. This club is a great way to relax while still making an impact.
Members will also have the opportunity to go on community service field trips at least once per school year, where they will have a hands-on experience that is fun, informative and fulfilling!
Hopefully, by encouraging the Stuyvesant community to help those who are less fortunate, we will bring about a change in our school community, one where we are encouraged to help one another and strive to brighten the lives of everyone we encounter.",https://linktr.ee/stuy_aha,"Meetings are scheduled and run by the two presidents, who are currently the two co-founders.
In the spring of a school year, a Google form will be released where the role of treasurer/secretary is available. Applicants must answer a few questions, and the presidents will appoint the candidate with the most promising submission by the end of the school year. When a president is going to graduate, their role will be added to that form at the beginning of the year. The new president will be appointed as VP and become President once the current one graduates.
If anyone in a leadership role is neglecting their position, meaning they don’t attend 3 consecutive meetings, or do but don’t do their share of work for 1 month, they will be removed from their position unless they have a valid medical or personal issue. If a temporary issue prevents them from attending meetings/doing work, they may take a temporary leave of absence, in which a new leader will be temporarily appointed. Leaves of absences last only until the end of the school year. Otherwise, it will be considered a resignation.
If any leader uses hate speech or posts hateful content, they will be removed. No bullying or discrimination is tolerated. Actions deemed worthy of impeachment will result in a club vote where the leader will be impeached if 70% of the club agrees. A new leadership application will be released, and the impeached leader will not be able to apply.
Presidents can step down before graduation, but must give 2 weeks notice before officially resigning. They must send out the leadership transfer form and both Presidents must appoint one new co-president before or during those 2 weeks.
Members must submit attendance. Members using hateful speech or commiting hateful/discriminatory actions while in attendance will not be tolerated. ","Although there are a few other clubs at Stuyvesant that also benefit homeless people, they do not focus directly on assisting the homeless and/or raising awareness on homelessness. As a club, we want to educate more people on the specifics surrounding homelessness and also support homeless people in various ways. Our members can also have fun and form connections while still making an impact regarding homelessness. To add on, our club can collaborate with other clubs that have similar goals (though not the same) to help create something bigger.","Our meeting schedule may vary depending on the time of the year, but we will meet at least once a month.

Stuyvesant Philharmonic,stuyphil,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyphil/37b836ff,"Stuyvesant Philharmonic is a completely student-run band that’s all about having fun and bonding through music. 
","Stuyvesant Philharmonic will allow students opportunities to both play in and lead a band. This band will be entirely student run and led. Students will experience what it is like to write for and lead a musical group, and the semantics involved in large scale productions and writing for multiple parts. All students will have the opportunity to arrange and compose pieces of their choice with the help of the leadership, and present them to be played by the band. Students who want it will receive instruction in composition and arranging, including guidance on methods, strategy, procedure, software, and instrumentation. Although the students who join the club will be experienced musicians who can competently play their instruments, they likely have never had any exposure to the concept of writing or arranging their own music, to be led by them. This means that this band will give them the opportunity to explore an entirely new side of music.
","The Stuyvesant Philharmonic will benefit the Stuyvesant Community by giving the musicians among it an opportunity to make friends and play together for fun, rather than as a class or for educational purposes. It will give students a place to relax and play music simply for the joy that it brings, to enjoy the company of other musicians and feel what it’s like to arrange and lead their own music. Musicians bond over making music, and this would be an ideal environment for musically inclined students to make friends and strong social connections, while also increasing their musical abilities. While it is true that our members will be already accomplished musicians, this band will highlight the aspect of music more important that technicality and skill: enjoyment and spreading feeling through the music that is played. 
Secondly, this club will reveal to students a previously unseen part of music, creating and arranging their own music. Arranging and composing music is a new experience for even the most talented musicians, and given that they are willing to try out the experience, having guidance can make the process much smoother. Additionally, this club might inspire those musicians who hadn’t even considered creating their own music an opportunity to try it out. 
Last but not least, the Stuyvesant Philharmonic will provide a place with musicians of all experience levels to imrpove and make new friends. Musicians are often given the stereotype of introverts that practice their music all day in their own rooms, but having a student-led, judgement free band will be a great place for not only these musicians, but these students to grow as people. 
",@stuyphilharmonic,"The Stuyvesant Philharmonic will have two Presidents, who stay in presidency until their graduation or impeachment. A month before the Presidents are ready to graduate, they will appoint through application two other students who they believe have contributed and shown dedication to the club, and are skilled at composition and arranging so that they can teach other students as well and write pieces for the band to play. This one month grace period will be important in the transitioning the next leaders. The previous Presidents must teach these appointees on how to carry on the club in the following years. The same one month grace period holds true for the members of the Executive Board, consisting of the Vice President, a Secretary, and one or two Arrangers. We will have a Vice President that acts as the chief adviser to the presidents, mainly working on logistics and keeping track of the atmosphere of the band. Since the Vice President will also play an instrument as a part of the band, they will get the best sense of how the Presidents are leading, making sure to suggest adjustments when needed to help the band run smoothly for all players. In addition, the band will require a secretary to handle paperwork and correspondence, to correspond with the Music Department and Administration to schedule concerts, expositions, and possibly instruction from one of the Music Teachers. Lastly, 1 or 2 experienced and talented arrangers will work with the Presidents and assist members who might want to arrange their own music. All positions will be applications will be Google Forms that will be submitted and completed. Musicians who show leadership and collaboration will be sought for leadership positions. If a member of the Executive Board is deemed unfit for the role, an anonymous voting procedure will be put in place, open to all members of the Philharmonic. 
","Although various bands and orchestras exist, none of those provide their members the opportunity to enjoy music making in a completely student led and judgment free zone. Having a more relaxed club rather than classes that have teachers will encourage players to join because of its lower commitment and satisfaction that’s not just for a grade. Playing pieces that band members want to play and have created or arranged themselves, and allowing a feeling of togetherness and fun to foster are other ways that separate us from school bands. We are also unique from the SMA since we focus on playing, and fostering a sense of community within a band rather than learning and teaching various instruments. The experience that this club’s leaders and potential members went through as part of SING! Band was a revolutionary feeling, one of a band that can put forth a stellar performance, but also knows to have fun and make the focus not educational, but entertaining and mentally relaxing. As directors of SophFrosh SING’s band, we’ve experienced firsthand how impactful a band can have on friendships and bonds you build. Bringing together all different types of instruments in a single band will create long lasting relationships and innovation in music. ","Our meeting schedule will be about once a week, but as we get closer to concerts and performances, we will be meeting up to two to three times a week.

Ethics Forum,EthicsForum,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/EthicsForum/369ca0d0,"The Ethics Forum’s mission is to teach students the importance of ethics, in order to create a more ethical community of students and future leaders.","The Ethics Forum seeks to create a space for Stuyvesant students to learn about various theories of ethics and morality. This can be achieved by through our three branches: the competitive Ethics Bowl branch, where students engage in conversations with other schools about how to apply ethics in different parts of our world in competitions across the city and state; the Publication branch, where ethics-related art and writing is published; and the Events Coordination branch, where events are organized for or brought to the Stuyvesant community. Specifically, the importance and value of ethics is brought to the attention of many students who see ethics as just an arbitrary concept ridden with gray areas and blurred lines. There are key differences between morals and ethics. Morals are most commonly defined as societal norms of behavior perceived as “good”. They don’t allow for deliberation, as they are agreed upon by all. Ethics, however, allow for more freedom of thinking and are more applicable in situations like business, politics, and individual struggles. Through discourse and deliberation, it is possible to challenge pre-established ideas of moral behavior in our pursuit in creating a better, more ethical community.","It is important for the students of Stuyvesant to have a club like that of the Ethics Forum, where it is possible to be pushed to our philosophical limits. In the competitive Ethics Bowl, students try to rationalize the ethical dilemmas presented, at the same time finding a way to refute or add on to the philosophical rationalization of the other team. The Publications branch allows students to have a more time-consuming approach to ethics in literature, their personal lives, or current events, examining the role ethics plays through writing and art. The Events branch is able to research and access events for club members, such as the PBS Youth Summit attended in 2018, and arrange events that bring ethics to the forefront of the Stuyvesant community at large, such as the Bioethics Symposium planned for 2020 (unfortunately, cancelled due to COVID-19). This club is also uniquely key for the students of Stuyvesant because of the rigorous academic career found here. When students spend morning and night covering and reviewing complex scientific and mathematical subjects, it’s difficult to dedicate time to the complex ethical situations surrounding our day-to-day lives. By ensuring that students have a firm grasp on ethics, students have the ability to conduct themselves in such a manner as well. More ethical conduct will help crack down on unethical behavior such as academic dishonesty. Finally, a club like this is crucial for students to alleviate the stresses of an academic career for an alternative that allows us to stimulate our minds in a way that is rarely experienced.",,"In the Ethics Forum, students are expected to learn about ethics, but responsibilities vary widely between departments. In the Publication department, students must follow their duties in a timely manner, such as submitting writing or edits on time with deadlines. Students in the Events branch will be expected to research and reach out to organizations relevant to ethics, and organize general events according to the deadlines appointed. Those in the Ethics Bowl branch will be expected to attend regular meetings and devote time to studying cases. Although timeliness and professionalism is expected, the commitment levels are not incredibly intense and understanding from leaders will be exercised. Students who abuse the club’s resources in order to achieve personal goals or goals unrelated to the topic of ethics will be ejected from the club. This also applies to club leaders. Presidents make executive decisions and are reported to by other department leaders, while Vice Presidents work under them and share many responsibilities. Heads of each department (sometimes separate though sometimes occupied by the President/VP) are responsible for their members and departments. 
All leaders are expected to put genuine work into creating activities and organizing productive, educational sessions. However, it is understood that Stuyvesant can be a highly stressful environment and refusing to offer any respite would be altogether cruel and would definitely affect our membership greatly. Ultimately, our impeachment protocols are very lax, and rely upon common sense, and allow for varying interpretations depending on the situation and consensus among students. A club leader can only be impeached if a majority of the club members agree, and the faculty leader (Ms. Hua) agrees as well. At the end of each school year there will be a meeting to decide the club leaders of next year by consensus among leaders, and if necessary, a vote. If a leader is impeached, the spot will be open for another member to be elected. Impeachment will only be necessary if the club leader/member is very obviously not contributing to the club or using the club as a means to their own ends. Impeachment should rarely be necessary, and if it is, it should be obvious to the members and the faculty leader.","Our club is not merely a philosophy club or like other public speaking clubs and publications. The Ethics Bowl competition is not meant to be argumentative, where one side seeks to expose or disprove the other side. The Ethics Bowl format facilitates open discourse that is solution oriented and motivated by ethical considerations, which model real life decision making at any level, whether the decision maker is in a corporate setting, a political setting, or in a personal setting. Our publication extends the work our competition branch does by generating content that’s accessible to the general public, as well as accepting work from our readers in a collaborative effort to produce more discussion on the importance of ethics. Our events branch seeks to provide opportunities and trips for not just our club members, but also students outside of our club who are interested in getting exposure to ethics and philosophy. ","Our schedule is flexible to accommodate as many of our members as possible, though we aim to meet 1-3 times a week depending on the season and how close to competition we are (for our competition branch). For our publication and coordination affairs branches, commitment is generally much lower, since most work can be done without meetings, but occasional meetings for executive decisions and for consolidating the club will be held a few times per semester.

Patriots Club,PatriotsClub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/PatriotsClub/8b0dd2bc,"The Patriots Club seeks to provide a safe environment for political discourse and debate, in a way that accommodates right wing voices.","In an urban and cosmopolitan environment such as Stuyvesant, those on the right side of the political spectrum are often silenced and shunned for expressing their beliefs and ideas. The patriots club provides a platform for meaningful conversations about hot-button and contemporary political issues through its hosting of open discussion as well as events based around dialogue with other political clubs at Stuyvesant. These events are in dire need to foster both an exchange of ideas and a diversity of thought that are missing greatly from the atmosphere of both the school and the city. Most of the time, the club is an open floor to discuss whatever issue is in the news or on the minds of members, but the patriots club also prepares for conversations on specific topics, which then becomes the focus of the session. Club members are expected to contribute dialogue and defend their opinions, both within the club circle and when the patriots club engages with other political clubs.","The patriots club's primary is as a free speech safe haven, and its benefits flow from that. Although it caters to students on the right who feel alienated from the hostile political environment of Stuy, progressives are strongly encouraged to join in order to develop a varied opinion upon which to structure conversation. By including conservatives, the club extends the overton window of acceptable political discourse to encompass a greater thought population, and the ensuing disagreement leads to a fruitful and insightful clash of philosophies and ideologies. This provides the opportunity to witness worldviews come into contact with one another, and in justifying one's positions get at the root of differences of opinion. Through the patriots club, students are able to grow in their ability to utilize rhetoric and verbalize their thoughts in a manner that is both persuasive and rational. In conversations among club members, students can work on their logical argumentation techniques through a thorough dissection of claims and rebuttals. In conversations with other clubs, students can work on employing rhetorical strategies to present their ideas publicly in a convincing manner. Additionally, through the intellectual diversity of the club, students are able to enrich their understanding of alternate positions and mature in their personal political outlooks.",,"The club has a few gradations in leadership, including president, vice president and officer. Leaders are appointed based on their commitment and contribution to the club, which takes into account one’s seniority, engagement in club activities and meetings, and value added to administrative and logistical conversations. These apply both in transfers between years and within years, but appointments for president and vice president will most likely not occur during the year. The appointment to officer will occur if there is unanimous agreement between the president and vice president. The president and vice president will work together to appoint their successors, by discussion and subsequent vote. If a member wants a leadership position, they need to show their commitment by attending most meetings and by adding value both during the meeting and in research for other events. If this is done they may be appointed as officers by the president and vice president and given greater responsibility over a particular area of club concern. Between years, the club will be entrusted with members of years long participation who understand the landscape, as well as the club’s goals. Such members will be appointed president and vice president by the incumbents presiding after they have talked about and voted on them. The impeachment process will occur if a club leader isn't performing their duties adequately-which is to the discretion of the president and vice president-or if a club leader violates rules. Such impeachments will be discussed among club leaders and voted on by all club leaders except for those under scrutiny. Impeachments will only occur under unanimous consent unless such an action will threaten the continued functioning of the club.","The patriots club is a bastion of intellectual diversity and the free exchange of ideas, in its acceptance of dialogue with ideologies of all colors and stripes. What is proprietary is the club’s expansion of the realm of discourse to include conservatives, which makes for productive political showdowns. This environment allows students to participate and observe genuine discourse where all sides are given the freedom they deserve, both to express their opinions and be criticized for them.

Through an uplifting community of students that share similar passions, we aim to create a culture of confidence and growth in our club that can carry into our futures, especially at times when we feel underrepresented and intimidated. Members will have access to a variety of resources to aid their professional development, along with the opportunity to network with and gain insight from experienced professionals.

The corporate field is one where this problem is very prominent, especially when it comes to women of color in leadership positions. In order to help break the stigma of female leaders in corporate settings, we aim to start empowering girls at an early age so that they learn how to have more confidence in their ideas along with how to assert their ideas powerfully and professionally for when the time comes. By joining our club, students at Stuyvesant will be in an environment of like-minded peers and have access to various resources and advice from experienced mentors, including Stuy alumni that already work in the field. From learning how to write a strong email to getting tips on networking, members of our club will gain a variety of skills that will equip them for success in the future, even outside of corporate settings.

All members of the club must be respectful of people and their gender, race, religion, and sexual orientation. There is a strict no bullying policy and if anything of the sort occurs, it will be reported to an advisor or staff member and that will lead to an immediate expulsion from the club. Leadership positions include up to two presidents, up to two vice presidents, and additional roles including social media manager(s), internal affair coordinator(s), HR officer, and development director(s). Leadership positions will be appointed through an application process and will always be based on experience and desire to grow rather than just seniority. The president(s) will work to decide on leadership positions based on the applications and interviews if they choose to hold them. Every year, all vice presidents and additional leaders must reapply for their position if they would like to continue with it or can apply for a different leadership position. Prior experience in a role that they are reapplying to will help the odds of being appointed to that position again. For president(s), their position can be transferred to them until they graduate if they so choose. Once the president(s) graduate or choose to give up their positions, the current vice president(s) will take their spot the following school year.

The club’s founders believe that no girl should pay an egregious amount of money just for workshops on how to be successful in the corporate world and they are here to help. Stuy WIBC caters to an audience that aspires to start an upbringing in an industry that is traditionally male dominated. ","Stuy WIBC hosts biweekly meetings, along with an event and a technical workshop each month (both of which are optional).

Stuy Open Gallery,stuyopengallery,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyopengallery/7701dabd,"Stuy Open Gallery offers students the opportunity to collectively plan an end-of-year gallery to commemorate the artwork of the club members. 
","Stuy Open Gallery is a creative hub for those eager to make art in a relaxed atmosphere. Regardless of artistic talent, preferred art medium, or art style, everyone is welcome to join and create art together in this club! Members can attend any meetings they want to, they get out of it what they put into it. Members may come to weekly meetings to build collective mini-exhibitions for the gallery, or their own personal portfolios. There is much freedom to be explored in this club. Artists will build on each other's ideas and find solace in the art of creating for creation's sake. In this club members will gain valuable experience working with others in the art field. As spring approaches, members will work together to plan a completely in-person showcase somewhere in the Stuyvesant building. Group collaboration will be essential to create funding, awareness, and the pieces for the gallery. ","Stuy Open Gallery benefits both the members of the club and even other students, who might not even be interested in art! By installing a public art show in our school, students who have never had exposure to the arts are able to enjoy the creations of their peers, and also gain insight into the art world. As for members, Stuy Open Gallery is a safe space where artists of Stuyvesant can come together and discuss inspirations, aspirations, and struggles. Stuy Open Gallery will forge social connections through team-building art exercises and collaboration. Giving artists of Stuyvesant a chance to come together once a week and put aside the pressures of homework and school and create. The limited art classes at Stuy are always in high demand. It is critical to offer highly academically focused Stuy students the opportunities to create, distress, and gain recognition for their often overlooked skills. The arts are involved in critical thinking skills, problem-solving and stress reduction. This is needed more than ever as we manage the complexities of this world. Artmaking has been proven helpful for stress reduction. Plus, access to free materials eliminates the obstacles many student artists encounter when starting a routine art practice. At Stuy, many receive validation through high grades. Stuy Open Gallery will give students the ability to gain gratification from something tangible, like their art pieces and the gallery they put together as a collective.",,"The three leadership positions are the president, art director, and secretary/gallery director. The art director guides each member with their art-making experience, the gallery director/secretary mainly assists with the logistics of making the gallery possible, and the president oversees both of these factors. 
 Each person appointed to their respected position will hold it until they graduate (this is to ensure that a sense of consistency is instilled) or need to be impeached. If oppressive or unfair behavior from a leader is displayed, a civil discussion will be held with all members of the club. After a conversation, there with be a vote where each member will cast if they want the person to be impeached or not. As for the transfer of leadership after a director graduates, there with be applications posted public via facebook and stuyopengallery social media accounts. To apply for the art director position, there will be a google form with questions about art techniques and such, with the chance to upload a portfolio. To apply for the gallery director position, the questions on the google form will be more primarily oriented around experience with leadership and organization. For either of these positions, one does not need to be in the club before applying, anyone from stuy who is interested is welcome to get the position. In order to be selected for president, one must already have been in the club and also fill out BOTH the art director and the gallery director form, because the president handles both matters. 
","Although art and creative clubs exist at Stuyvesant, none offer an opportunity for artwork to be shown in a public, physical space easily accessible to the rest of the Stuyvesant community. It is very evident that the halls of Stuyvesant prioritize recognition of STEM achievement. A truly inclusive learning environment would celebrate all subjects, including visual arts as an area of student progress. Stuy Open Gallery is also unique because it gives each member complete freedom of what they wish to put on display. There are no externally regulating criteria. The gallery is curated by students for students. ","Throughout the year meetings are once a week, depending on member availability. As spring approaches, Stuy Open Gallery will meet 1-2 times per week to plan the gallery event.

Stuyvesant Hindu Students Council (HSC),stuyhsc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyhsc/e8c27794,The Hindu Students Council (HSC) aims to form a welcoming and open environment for those who would like to learn more about Hinduism.,"With biweekly meetings, students will be able to discuss and follow through with different ideas and practices pertaining to Hinduism. Each meeting, club leaders will go over a different aspect of the culture and how groups of people from distinct regions practice it. In addition to learning about this, students will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the different forms of music and dance that people can enjoy in different places of worship. Group discussions and talks by various speakers regarding identity, contributions of Hindus in fields like science and art, etc. With the help of the HSC members, this club hopes to educate and inform students about Hinduism and provide a better understanding for those who want to explore more about it. Club leaders will also arrange an opportunities document for volunteering with local groups and charities, raising money for underprivileged children, and opportunities for virtual conferences, networking opportunities, etc. for Hindu students and those who want to explore and reach beyond Stuyvesant to make a difference in their community. Group members are encouraged to foster connections with peers in addition to undergoing their own religious journey. There is no religious or devotional requirement, as we wish to be inclusive towards all students from the Stuyvesant community. To reiterate, club members will learn about important Hindu holidays, religious texts, food, cultural contributions, music, dance, and more. ","The goal is to increase understanding and knowledge surrounding Hinduism through group discussions. Each meeting there will be a slideshow constructed by the club leaders going over different topics and issues concerning the Hindu community, with opportunities to discuss opinions and thoughts. This club is also willing to speak and communicate with other organizations to promote uniqueness and distinctiveness within the Stuyvesant community. Media is also one of the larger aspects of Hinduism, as it is portrayed differently in different films/natoks and so that will also be one of the different topics discussed. Different community events like volunteering in temples and places of worship will be encouraged and be led by event leaders / the co-presidents. Some festivals to be focused on include: Diwali, Holi, Navratri, Pongal, etc. All of these events aren’t as publicized, which also allows for many to not be aware of them and their historical backgrounds, despite Hinduism being one of the oldest religions. All of these opportunities will allow priority to Hindu students in order to meet others and foster discussion about students’ heritage. Not only this, but students will be able to express themselves through songs, dance, music, and art, while also learning about different pieces, all of which enhance understanding of this polytheistic religion. The presence of a Hindu Students Council at Stuyvesant would help to diversify and strengthen bonds within the community as well as incorporating the ideas of students with similar interests and backgrounds.",https://linktr.ee/stuyhsc,"There are two co-presidents that will host each meeting. The co-presidents will be determined based on commitment and dedication to the club. Co-presidents will remain in their positions unless they wish to step down. There will be one outreach director/social media manager to manage the social media (along with the presidents), one treasurer to manage finances, and one project director in charge of looking for opportunities and networking. 

If members feel as though the co-leaders or any of the board are not correctly devoting effort to the club, the group members will then gather together and vote on whether or not they deserve a strike. They will only receive a strike if more than 50% of club members (including the co-presidents) believe it seems fit. If a leader accumulates three strikes, their leadership will be revoked and a new leader will be elected from a vote that'll take place during one of the meetings. Otherwise, just before the leaders graduate, they will select two underclassmen to take their position(s), and present them to the rest of the club where they will explain why they are best for that position. ","No other organization at Stuyvesant goes in depth about Hinduism and the culture surrounding it, as well as countries that are mostly Hindu based - such as India. Many Hindu students are underrepresented and don’t have the opportunity to learn more about their culture and the different facets surrounding it. Club leaders will provide resources to students and raise awareness for Hindu Heritage, Culture and History, empowering students to be more confident and knowledgeable. In addition to religion, this club will delve into the politics and different historical/current events that have to do with Hindu issues. Students will have the opportunity to debate about different situations in a nonjudgmental environment. 	",Our meeting schedule will be at least once a month and biweekly in the Spring.

This is a very welcoming club that encourages anyone who is keen on learning about any aspect of the sports world to join. Our meeting schedule will be flexible for members and we’ll cover everything from the basics to more specific fields like sports medicine or finance. Based on everyone’s personal interests, we’ll assign members to project-specific teams with goals and deadlines. Weekly meetings will be more relaxed and fun as we’ll play games/competitions with prizes, bring in snacks, and watch movies together. Furthermore, we’re interested in setting up occasional speaker events with professionals to expose our members to the first-hand experience of the sports industry. Together, everyone at the club will learn from each other and foster an amazing environment while pursuing our goals to promote and improve Stuy’s sports culture.","This is a unique professional field with increasing opportunities. Sports management is crucial for every sport and is essential to a career in a sport related job. Data technology is a constantly growing field as technology improves and advances and the possibilities are always increasing. Data analysts collect information on athletes in the form of raw numbers, assess and analyze that data, and communicate their work in an effective manner to improve the overall performance of the athlete. By understanding this field of profession, many career paths will open up in the future and there will be constant opportunities in this ever-growing area of study. We’ll be exploring all kinds of sports and members will learn about various new concepts in maths, technology, and sports management in an engaging manner. Also, the club will experience what it means to set short and long term goals and work towards achieving those goals as a group. As previously stated, we will be relatively flexible with attendance but we expect commitment from everyone who is devoted to the goals of the club. Overall, this club will stay interesting, engaging, and entertaining for all members. If anyone is interested in learning more about this topic, then they will definitely be able to work on their skills in this developing, welcoming community.",https://discord.gg/v4ZpFDSVhB,"This club will have one president, two vice presidents, an outreach director, a treasurer, and sport specific team leaders, with possibly more positions coming in the future. We encourage healthy competition for all positions. Obviously while we do keep our schedule flexible for our members, we will observe attendance and participation. More devoted members who show passion and high commitment to the club and contribute constantly will be more seriously considered for leadership positions in the future. Members will be divided into specific groups, with each group focusing on one sport. Every group will have a group lead who will manage everyone, organize responsibilities, and report overall progress to the club leaders. These group lead positions will be decided through a voting system. At the end of each semester, members will vote for who they believe should be team lead for the following cycle, and the person with the most votes will be given the responsibility. The president and vice presidents will oversee the overall club which includes setting up large scale events, reaching out to external organizations and managing the club’s short and long term goals. A president, vice president, outreach director, or treasurer will be replaced once they have graduated from their senior year. At the end of the senior year of a club leader, a form will be sent out to all members and those interested may apply for these roles. After a written application and an interview, the new club leaders will be decided. Of course, in the unlikely event that any member or leader of the club behaves inappropriately, members can reach out to existing club leaders who will take immediate action to resolve the issue.","There is currently no other club at Stuyvesant that focuses on this specific field.

Stuyvesant Fashion Club,sfc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/sfc/cb4ca3e2,The SFC is about creating a community of people passionate about fashion and everything to do with it. It is accepting and welcoming of everybody. ,"The Stuyvesant Fashion Club has multiple purposes. One primary purpose is to introduce people to fashion, from those who simply want to learn how to dress better to those interested in learning about influential designers or contemporary fashion history. The club is also intended to spread information about sustainable and affordable fashion to the people at Stuy in order to make it more accessible and conscious. Another purpose of the Stuyvesant Fashion Club is to contribute to charitable ventures either relate to fashion or employing fashion. Examples include clothing drives and clothing designed and sold for charity. It is also meant to be a place for those already interested in fashion to come and discuss it with their peers. Furthermore, in its mission of fashion education, Stuy Fashion Club would also allow students to share important things that they feel passionate about in relation to fashion, be it a presentation on an important collection or on current events in regards to fashion. ","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community in a number of ways. It will provide a space for people interested in the underrepresented art form of fashion to come and discuss their interest. It would also add vibrancy to the day to day life of Stuyvesant by teaching people how they can express themselves through fashion. Yet another thing that the Stuyvesant Fashion Club can and will do is provide the community of Stuyvesant with information on how to more consciously and affordable express themselves through fashion, from thrifting advice to providing names of small businesses to support, as well as informing them about brands which may serve as alternatives to more problematic ones. Furthermore, the Stuy Fashion Club would also attempt to provide Stuy students to contribute to charity in a number of ways. From holding charity giveaways/raffles to holding clothing drives, to designing and selling clothing for charity, the Stuy Fashion Club would allow Stuy students to contribute to charity while giving back to the community itself. In summary, the club will strive to enhance the Stuyvesant community by providing an place dedicated to the love and discussion of fashion, as well as to charity and giving back to the communities that surround them. Furthermore, the SFC will hold collaborations with various other clubs, as it has in the past, building a sense of artistic community within Stuyvesant. 
",@stuyfashionclub on Instagram,"The leadership positions at the Stuy Fashion Club will be President, Vice President, and possibly Charitable Ventures Director. This is tentative, however, and new leadership positions will be created should the club find a need for them. The only specific protocols that members are expected to follow are to be tolerant and respectful of others, to be open minded considering there will be discussion of an art form, and to be passionate about or at the very least interested in fashion. The policy of transfer of leadership between school years would generally be a discussion or vote between the President, Vice President, and the Charitable Ventures Director. Anybody has the potential to attain a leadership position should they demonstrate enough of an interest to what the club is trying to do as well as dedication to the club, however priority will likely be put on promoting people who have already attained leadership positions, though it will be on a case by case basis. ","The Stuyvesant Fashion Club is unique because it is the only organization at Stuy to focus on fashion as an art form - we discuss, present, and critique fashion. In addition, we are unique because we facilitate collaborations with other clubs at Stuy, as well as Stuy creatives. We have collaborated with the Photography Club and student Lea Esipov (in a jewlery making workshop), and we look forward to working with many more parts of the Stuyvesant community. We want to be a platform for creatives in fashion and adjacent fields. ","Our meeting schedule varies, but generally we will strive to meet every week.

Girls Chess Club,GirlsChessClub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/GirlsChessClub/b07a0248,"The Stuyvesant Girls Chess Club works toward presenting an encouraging and collaborative environment for girls, with any experience level, in chess!","Chess is mentally challenging and abstract game that requires strategy. However, despite its toughness, it can also be very fun to play! The Girls Chess Club works to create a supportive environment for girls in chess, whether it is with experienced players or new people who are interested in learning! This club is open to all experience levels, providing for girls who just want to have some fun and play a few games or also for women who are more serious and hope to compete competitively! The club will host meetings once a week where members would be able to practice, learn from, and play with each other. The club would also organize groups of people to play in tournaments whether there are more local ones in the city or larger ones at a national level. As chess is a predominantly male sport, many girls feel isolated and stop playing after elementary/middle school. The Girls Chess Club wants to motivate girls to continue, or start, a passion, despite the overwhelming gender gap in chess. The club hopes, by not only increasing the numbers of girls playing chess but also their overall commitment to it, to slowly work towards closing the gender gap.","The Girls Chess Club encourages girls to play chess and participate in scholastic chess tournaments. The All Girls Chess Club is a welcoming place for students to make new friends and feel open to making mistakes and learning together. Furthermore, it allows for unique opportunities to compete at All Girls' Chess tournaments and showcase the highest potential in the players. The Stuyvesant Girls Chess Club allows players to foster a sense of community which is not easily achieved, especially taking into consideration the huge gender gap in chess. The club will allow individuals to strengthen their skills while still working in a group setting and having a fun time! This organization hopes to create a strong and active Girls Chess Club to inspire future grades to participate. In addition, chess has a very long and rich history not only about variations of the game but also about who can play it. So, as the club studies and practices different openings, members will receive an insight into the deep history of such moves and become knowledgeable about important and successful chess players. Chess also helps stimulate the brain and there has been a positive correlation between students excelling in Chess and in other STEM fields. This can encourage female chess players in Stuyvesant to pursue STEM outside of the chess world.
",Instagram: @Stuygirlschessclub,"The Stuyvesant Girls Chess Club currently consists of two Co-Presidents and one Vice-President. These 3 people in executive positions will work together to provide for the rest of the members and make sure the club is running smoothly. They will make decisions on activities for meetings and be the people to reach out to if any problems occur. In addition to that, the club will have 2 leadership positions open; a Social Media Manager/PR and a Director of communications. Leadership applications will be accepted through a round of responses on google forms and the position will be determined by a following interview. Leadership positions are appointed to members who show a willingness to be committed to going to meetings, planning schedules, attending tournaments, and interacting on social media. Executive and leadership positions will be retained throughout the years until graduation unless noted otherwise. If an executive or leader is not keeping up with the required work, not attending the club or board meetings, or not being respectful to fellow members, they face the possibility of being voted out of their position. Besides that, as higher grades graduate, those in line for executive positions will take it up and leadership applications will once again be sent out. If a member is not being respectful to their club mates, they will be removed.
","Stuyvesant's Girls Chess Club not only focuses on practicing and learning but also has a top priority of providing a comfortable and uplifting environment as the club recognizes the vital importance of a good community. In addition, since the club has a specific audience, it allows members to create a strong team for girls' chess tournaments like All Girls Nationals. The club is hoping to partner with organizations such as “Her Move Next” which has a similar mission to support female chess players. Furthermore, as the club builds a strong, connected team it will have many opportunities to go around the city, state, country, and even the world playing tournaments. This activity also hopes to transform the stigma around chess and support a low-stress environment, where members can develop a new hobby and enjoy their experience. Lastly, due to the strategic thinking that playing chess develops, a specific skill set is created and can be applied later in life when in adult-life scenarios. 
","The meeting schedule currently aims to meet once a week on Tuesdays. The club hopes to continue this throughout the school year.

This club also intends to spread awareness about the challenges the siblings of children with disabilities or other health concerns may face, as well as educate volunteers about the benefit and gratification that accompanies volunteering in this field. The club strives to create a nurturing environment where siblings and volunteers can share their interests with each other and form close bonds, uplifting all the participants involved. The planned recreational workshops will follow a four-week rotating schedule of various themes (i.e. creative writing, literary circle/ art, environmental activism), and will serve to empower participants and cultivate their creative expression. These workshops will be balanced with bonding activities and icebreakers that would further solidify the close bond between members and the siblings. At the conclusion of each 4-week activity session, sibling participants can choose to display their work on an online magazine issue or infographic on a website. Hence, in order to maintain a smoothly running system, members who are already paired with their sibling participants are encouraged and expected to attend bonding sessions as well as the small group workshops. ","By building a network of students and sibling participants who confide in and support each other, Project SibSupport offers a positive and heartwarming environment that counteracts the isolation that some may especially feel during the pandemic. An enjoyable reprieve from school work, this club also enables students to form meaningful bonds with sibling participants. Project SibSupport provides a safe and welcoming community for both student volunteers and sibling participants to freely express their opinions and share their interests. Moreover, the efforts of the members will spread joy and happiness among the sibling participants, which in turn leads to emotional gratification from the volunteers. In a more technical aspect, this club also provides an opportunity for student volunteers to take initiative in their community and develop their leadership skills. Project SibSupport provides a medium in which less outspoken members can take risks and become more comfortable speaking in public. Through multiple info sessions with guest speakers who work in healthcare social work and psychology, volunteers will also be able to learn more about this widely unknown professional area as well as understand the possible challenges siblings of family members with disabilities may face on a more personal level.

At the beginning of spring semester, there will be a leadership position google form application sent out to gauge interest. Only members that have shown clear dedication and passion for the SibSupport workshops by participating in volunteer sessions or meetings and proposing new ideas will be considered for the interview.

This club also provides members with greater insight in other non-profit areas and organizations they can volunteer for in the future.

The Wellness Council was created for students to have the opportunity to achieve personal, academic, developmental, and social success. The Wellness Council acknowledges that students need positive, supportive, and health-promoting learning environments at every level, in every setting, throughout the school year. We make sure we can provide healthy instruction, environment and opportunities by making students engage in new opportunities and create healthy behaviors. We make sure students in Stuyvesant have plenty of opportunities to be active, that students receive proper education about health, that students receive health services, that nutrition is an important part of their lives, and that they are motivated to combat the heavy workload at Stuy. In order to advance this purpose, the Wellness Council raises awareness about issues that students may overlook such as the negative consequences of a lack of sleep and the effects of mental health deterioration. Students should learn to make their mental and physical wellbeing a priority. We create many social media campaigns to promote this message, particularly catering to the theme of the months, such as Mental Health month. We also create our own in school initiatives, such as spreading quotes of kindness and collecting data on school water fountains to secure funding for new ones. Along with the recently created Wellness Coalition, the Council works towards spreading new health initiatives across the grades. We participate in the yearly health fair as well as Women’s Day Run. We have many volunteering opportunities, and strive to make Stuy students the healthiest they can be.","The Wellness Council recognizes that Stuyvesant students and students in general often have a hard time maintaining their physical and mental health amidst the pressure of grades, homework, school, and extracurriculars. To remedy this, the Wellness Council aims to find ways to create healthier lifestyles for busy Stuy students without causing their grades to drop or for them to sacrifice other important things. Health—emotional, physical, intellectual, and mental—is so crucial for everyone, and the Wellness Council understands firsthand the difficulty of balancing health and educational success. The Wellness Council will create a healthier and happier student body by sticking to its principles and helping out students with any difficulties they encounter. For instance, in the past, the Wellness Council has managed various social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube) to promote wellness challenges over the various school breaks. The Council also has worked on beautification murals, spreading quotes of kindness, and forming a Wellness Coalition. The Coalition’s sole purpose is to unite the health clubs to brainstorm ideas that benefit the student body and to receive additional help on each club’s personal initiatives. The Council has written and published multiple articles about health and wellness topics, including sleep deprivation, dehydration, eating disorders, and participation in extracurriculars.

If one of the leaders is deemed to be unfit for their role or is acting inappropriately, there is an option for impeachment. This would require all members to vote, and if there is a majority, the leader will be impeached.

","Stuyle aims to confront the implications of social media through discussion-based events and talk circles. We will invite guest speakers, who can range from teachers to the designer of brands. This is a welcoming environment where stories will be shared, laughter will be made, but most importantly, awareness is raised. Stuyle addresses questions such as “Why are we tempted to follow trends? Who has the power to create trends? Why are there distinctions between depictions of men's and women’s clothing? How does social media reflect the culture in clothing?” Stuyle uses the founded knowledge and awareness to make social media more approachable. We recognize the beneficial aspect of social media in the age of technology. Stuyle has presentations and events that focus on a specific object that has been made “trendy” through social media and address whether that is culturally appropriate and if there are exceptions. Most importantly, Stuyle will host projects where our members learn the significance of certain clothing pieces and objects such as the hanbok, the hijab, and the durag. Clothing is a prominent part of social media, yet through social media, we oftentimes overlook the importance of and even antagonize certain clothing pieces and objects- it’s time we address this so that we can build a more accepting society.","Stuyle relate issues surrounding social media and the individual’s relationship with it to the Stuyvesant community itself. Social media platforms impact the way others view the image, personal styles, and even personalities of many of our peers, intentional or not. This is especially relatable to certain members of our community with prominent followings, where they experience changes in their livelihoods and certain expectations through their following. However, even to those with minimal social media presence, we all can relate to one thing: we’ve all been impacted one way or another by social media. Stuyle fosters a community that teaches members how to be self-conscious users.
We explore social issues like the expectations placed on body image, connections of fashion to one’s beauty, and taboos surrounding certain types of clothing. This includes questions of what constitutes a clothing piece as “inappropriate” or “not flattering”. It’s evident that all of these connect to bigger issues of male and female stereotypes, body image, which is spurred by societal standards of beauty, and cultural differences. Social media plays a prominent role in our daily lives, yet it often depicts people and their cultures in a one-dimensional way. By having open discussions, we strive to make social media more approachable for the Stuyvesant community. ",https://www.instagram.com/stuyvesantstyle/,"Stuyle is composed of a president, a vice president, branch directors, a webmaster, and general members. There will be applications sent out at the beginning of the semester, which those interested in leadership positions must fill out and submit. Leadership positions are given to people who can demonstrate dedication and commitment to the club. Anyone can apply but priority will be given to those who demonstrate interests and leadership skills. As for specific protocols, everyone must be respectful and welcoming to one another. Especially when there are discussions that may reveal personal experiences, it is absolutely mandatory that everyone acts appropriately. If there is an instance where a member feels uncomfortable, they can speak to one of the branch directors or the presidents and we will take action accordingly. Pronouns must be respected. Vice President, branch directors, and webmaster positions are kept for two semesters. After, there will be another round of applications, but the same directors can apply again. If there is a new director in office, it is expected that the prior director will assist in the transition to the new director. This includes teaching the implications of the leadership role and transferring files. Additionally, there is an impeachment process. If one of the leaders is deemed unfit for their role or is acting inappropriately, depending on the situation, all members will vote anonymously. If there is a majority, the leader will be impeached.","Stuyle is unique in that we specifically focus on the societal and mental impacts of social media, particularly on self-image and stylistic choices. It is the only club in Stuyvesant that strives to address questions about the cultural and social implications of social media in our society. We address the hindrance of cultural wear as well as cultural appropriation. For instance, is it gatekeeping to want to keep jade jewelry only for a certain ethnicity? How is a culture depicted in society? Why does that lead to stereotypes? We foster a welcoming community that understands the impacts of social media on our livelihoods and how that’s reflected in our daily decision and outlook. ","Stuyle meets 3 times a month, depending on when members are most available. For now, these meetings will be held both in person or virtually through zoom for the safety of all members, leaders, and guests. In person meetings will be aimed to be held at 4pm and virtual meetings at later in the day, like 6pm, to ensure our members can get home without any feelings of being rushed.

They cultivate democratic leadership skills, challenge one another to think critically, advocate their own opinions, develop respect for opposing views and learn to rise above self-interest to promote the public good. As a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, JSA is committed to developing a diverse, cross-section of young leaders for a democratic society. The JSA was created by and for young people interested in what happens around them - from politics, to how government works, and contributing to their community. Since its founding in 1934, JSA has served as a place where students build leadership skills, learn civil debate, and strengthen their engagement through volunteering and activism. More than 500,000 students have graduated high school as more active, informed members of their community as a result of their participation in JSA.

At the Stuyvesant chapter of JSA, we participate in in-school debates with other club members on a given political topic. Members can either choose to debate on behalf of a political position or choose to simply watch. At the end of the debates, everyone votes on the topic, as a result of the debates. We participate in the national JSA organization by attending Congresses in Washington D.C., Boston, Connecticut, and virtually. At these conferences, we debate with students across the nation in a variety of topics. ""","The Stuyvesant Junior States of America benefits Stuyvesant by offering a non-partisan platform for Stuyvesant students to have their voices heard. In JSA, students are able to learn of new opinions and values that they would not have been privy to, offering new possibilities for the diversity of political thought. JSA allows for an exchange of ideas through stimulating student debates, thought talks, problem-solving, and a variety of simulations. By participating in these activities, Stuyvesant students gain a more intelligent and informed viewpoint. Students also gain public speaking skills, as there are bimonthly debates and triannual national conferences. At these national conferences, students often speak in front of hundreds of people, really helping to develop public speaking. Additionally, Stuyvesant students become more active participants in their communities. JSA directly promotes engagement in its students through volunteering and activism. Stuyvesant JSA members are able to meet and engage with elected officials, public administrators, members of the media, lobbyists, civic leaders, and business executives in lively dialogues about the public policy issues facing this nation during national conferences. Stuyvesant also gains a level of prestige from the Junior States of America chapter. For the past four years, we have had a student either win or be nominated for the ""Best Speaker Award"" at a national conference. Stuyvesant JSA helps students interested in politics, debate, and activism hone in on their interests and grow as people.",,"Section A: Any student may run for office provided that the person is a chapter member in good standing and meets the set amount of required events set by the President & Advisor of that year.

Section B: The officers shall be elected by secret ballot at the second to last meeting of the elected term. Only chapter members may vote, and each chapter member will be granted one vote for President and one vote for Vice President. For the Presidential and Vice Presidential elections, the two (2) candidates that receive the most votes cast, win the election.

Section C: The term of the officers shall start June 1 and end the following May 31 of the next year. In the case of a vacant position, the President may appoint a replacement with the approval of a majority of the chapter. If the President resigns or is impeached, the Vice President is to be the replacement with the approval of a majority of the chapter. 

Section D: There shall be two (w) elected officers:
1. There shall be one President. The president is the chief executive officer of the chapter and is responsible for representing the chapter at all events. The President will preside over all meetings and be a member of all committees. They are responsible for running the chapter’s educational program. The President may appoint other officers as the need arises.
2. There shall be one Vice President. The Vice President assists the President and can become a President if a position becomes available. (See section C.)

Section E: The President and Vice President shall have a cabinet. Positions for the cabinet are determined yearly by the President. Members are selected for positions via applications sent out by the President by Election Day. Anyone can apply for Cabinet.

Section F: Officers may be impeached for immoral conduct or failure to meet the responsibilities set forth in this Constitution by a ⅔ vote of chapter members. To call an impeachment vote, an impeachment petition signed by at least 4 chapter members must be submitted to the teacher advisor.

The organization will provide many of our students with their first experiences surrounding this topic. Our meetings will start with the basics and slowly work up to more in-depth and complicated topics, so no prior experience is required (although it certainly helps). Leaders of our organization will teach participants many useful skills which will be useful later in their lives if they choose to pursue careers revolving around finance and economics. Members are expected to show up to meetings consistently, as catching up on any missed material we present will be both confusing and challenging. Meetings will generally revolve around PowerPoint presentations, but discussion, debate, and asking questions will also play a key role in making sure that everyone is comfortable with what we are teaching and that we are doing a good job presenting the information.","This club will educate the student body on the financial sector of economics, an integral part of a professional career. To be a successful individual in this society, one must have a thorough grasp of the fiscal matters that exist all around us, which are all too often unknown to many. The transition from high school to college, and further into independence as an adult, can be very confusing and often frightening, although with proper knowledge of finances this transition becomes much less daunting. We hope to be this liaison that many students require, especially in a school like Stuyvesant where many come from immigrant households that do not fully understand the finances of our country and thus cannot pass any knowledge of the subject onto their children. Our board and leaders are very knowledgeable in this field and would be able to provide not only support but also guidance to students who wish to better understand the topics at hand. Not only would it be a great resource to those who wish to pursue a career in business and finance, but also to all who wish to be prosperous citizens and contribute to the economy on a greater scale. Overall, we believe this would be a very beneficial activity to Stuyvesant, as we would provide valuable information that would benefit the community both short term and long term.",https://www.instagram.com/stuy.investment/,"All leadership positions in the club are appointed to diligent members who consistently show up to meetings and fill out a written application. When the previous leadership graduates or steps down, they will choose their successors via a written application.

If an individual with a position stops showing up to meetings or contributing to our presentations without any explanation, one of the Presidents or Vice Presidents will reach out to them in order to reach an agreement about their responsibilities within the club. This may lead to an impeachment, in which case the board will vote on a current active member to bring into said position. Members are expected to show up to a majority of the lecture meetings we have, since information we teach later in the academic year will require previous knowledge from our previous meetings.

Any member can fill these out and the president and vice president from the current year will review them. It will be very brief and will require members to enter some information about themselves as well as write a response to a question. After the submission date has passed, the leaders will choose between the responses based on who is the most qualified and the quality of the response, and whoever’s application seems the best suited for president will acquire the role and the same for vice president. As for the transfer of leadership positions between school years, members will keep their positions until they graduate, leave the club, or obtain a different role within the club. Members are expected to be inclusive when speaking and open-minded and should feel free to ask any questions that they have to the leaders of the club as well as the other members. In terms of protocols, members should attend all meetings and notify leaders ahead of time if they cannot attend or would prefer a different time. They should be actively communicating and should try to respond as soon as possible if contacted digitally. This would require them to be actively checking their methods of communication and checking to see if there have been any updates. If the members of a club feel that the leaders are not performing well, they can provide feedback in an anonymous form to the leaders.

","The purpose of BMEI is to encourage students to learn more about medicine and to get involved in their community. The club is a branch of the non-profit: Biology and Medicine Exploration Initiative. It hopes to provide opportunities to assist in medical research and to obtain internships and volunteer jobs. During future meetings, guest speakers will speak about their careers and will outline why they pursued medicine as a career path and how they got to be where they are today. This will be a chance for students who are medically inclined or interested in science to delve deeper into what it means to work in medicine. In addition, the club assists students with biology classes they are currently taking, such as AP Biology. It offers group tutoring services and resources to help students prepare for exams and to succeed in their classes. The club is low-commitment, allowing members to decide how much time they would like to devote to their learning and to choose what meets their needs. 
","This activity allows students to explore a career path in medicine in a stress-free, interactive environment. It provides them the chance to see the many routes they can take to pursue what they want in college and beyond. It is very beneficial to anyone unsure of their interests because they can explore what is available to them in a risk-free context and decide if it is right for them or not. The club is not just targeted at medically-inclined students, it also provides a useful resource for students currently enrolled in biology-related courses. It provides resources to tackle difficult concepts and to prepare students for exams such as the APs. This activity doesn’t require participants to attend every meeting, because they can choose how much help they need with handling the large amounts of coursework they have to complete. In addition, if one is interested in a specific field of medicine, one can choose to only attend meetings where a lecture about that topic is being held. This activity can also be helpful to those interested in finding unique ways to serve their community through their specific skill set. The club helps students research volunteer opportunities, discover new subjects within biology and medicine, and get involved in their fields of interest.

There will also be questions about their reasons for interest in the job and how they plan to contribute to the club.

They should actively check email for posts on StuyActivities and meeting notifications. Members will be given a google form that they can fill out if they are experiencing problems with leaders of the club and these problems will be addressed promptly.

Games can get competitive but there is no reward for winning so remember to play with good sportsmanship and respectfully. Meetings are generally held in the 3 floor gym although if a sports team has reserved the gym that time the meetings may be switched to the 6 floor gym.","This activity has various benefits for both the individual and the Stuyvesant community. For starters, simply playing basketball provides great exercise which can be hard to get especially during a very busy school week. It also promotes teamwork because if you want to win clearly you need to communicate well with your teammates. This makes it very easy to meet new people as well. Every club allows you to meet new people but unlike others there's a certain connection from competing together that can not be found in other types of clubs. This club can be a great way to foster connections especially among people who have similar interests to you. However, by far the biggest advantage comes if you have interest in making the Stuyvesant basketball team. The coach of the varsity team attends every single meeting and both captains generally attend every meeting as well. Its a great way to make connections with the coach and talk to him, as well as show him and the other players what you are capable of doing on the court.

During the meetings they are simply a player just like everyone else, in fact sometimes they're treated harsher simply because more is expected out of them. The leaders have never had to have been removed in previous years, but if one of the leaders or captains were to abuse their power or If they were to be kicked off the basketball team then they would no longer be a club leader. In that instance they would most likely not be replaced until the next year when two new leaders/captains were elected.","The basketball club is very tightly tied to the actual basketball team which is quite unique. Unlike other sport clubs participating in this one will greatly assist you if you are interested in making the basketball team.

","Stuyvesant Science Bowl aims to provide an opportunity for students to represent Stuyvesant High School in the high school division of the National Science Bowl (NSB) competition. The NSB is a competition that rigorously tests students' skills in science and mathematics. Although a select number of our members will go on to participate in the annual NYC regional competition and possibly the national competition, which will be fairly decided through attendance, performance, and sportsmanship, all members will have the opportunity to broaden their scientific interests, interact with a community of students that share their interests, and participate in invitational competitions and scrimmages. Often, our members discover their academic passions and bond with others with similar interests through their involvement with the Stuyvesant Science Bowl community. The main purpose of Stuyvesant Science Bowl is to provide our members with an environment in which they can explore and develop their passions for science and mathematics. 
","Students can stand to gain experience working with others through practices and competitions, due to the emphasis on teamwork and quick communication of the Science Bowl competition format (for more information, refer to the additional information section), and join a friendly community of other students that share an interest in STEM. Similar to other clubs, underclassmen can also find a community of upperclassmen that are willing to provide help and advice. They can also gain an understanding of multiple fields of sciences, which can help them find their interests in science and math, gain knowledge that may be useful in science and math classes offered at Stuy, and also possibly find connections between fields in STEM, which can be useful for deciding what to study, both in Stuy (electives, APs, etc.) and beyond. Members may also improve other various skills, such as reaction time, quick thinking, etc. through repeated participation in practice rounds due to the fast-paced nature of the competition.

The impeached leader is, however, still allowed to run in this election. If a significant majority of the club is dissatisfied with a designated leader (namely the captain of a team), after the approval of both the president and faculty advisor a new captain will be chosen. It is the responsibility of the vice president and president to choose a new captain. Their choice has to be approved by the faculty advisor. Science Bowl will be a fairly informal club; members can do what they like as long as they don't hinder the practice or experience of other members during meetings. However, dedication and competence will be determining factors in the selection of the regional competition.
","Science Bowl is unique in that it requires both extensive academic knowledge and strong cooperation skills. The competition format provides an opportunity for students to improve their skills in their various scientific disciplines in a less formal and much more entertaining way than other similar competitive clubs. Science Bowl isn’t simply regurgitating facts from various textbooks and taking traditional exams like in school. While Science Bowl rewards and encourages learning, the format of competition requires that members must cooperate and be open to teamwork in order for the team to succeed. It is impossible for one person to know every discipline and compete by himself. Different members specialize in the areas they are most comfortable in, and when it is time for competition, everyone is working together to answer as many questions.

Meetings will typically consist of community round-ups, collaborative / individual drawing sessions, technical workshops, and much more. StuyCanvas may also organize activities outside of school hours, such as possible volunteering opportunities, as well as trips to museums around the city. Moreover, members will also be encouraged to participate in challenges to be done in their own time, such as our monthly art trade. 

Meetings will be held in Ms. Chu’s room, such that members can have easy access to any supplies that they may need. Artists that would like to work in alternate / digital mediums may bring their own materials. 

While club activities are primarily organized by the club leaders, members will have the opportunity to contribute and even host their own workshops. While StuyCanvas intends to be a low-commitment club, regular participation is expected.

It's difficult to find time for personal art during the school year, and the club is hoping to carve time out of busy schedules to draw with like-minded classmates. StuyCanvas would be excited to have another artist drawing, painting, and creating alongside the club.
","StuyCanvas to wants to provide a space for visual creativity, where it is often absent in Stuyvesant's STEM-oriented curriculum. This club offers a space for artists of all levels, skill sets, and mediums to find common ground through shared interests, while simultaneously improving their skills. 

Club meetings will often be centered around developing member’s technical skills such as anatomy, color theory, and composition. Members will be encouraged to actively apply these lessons to their work both inside and outside of the club, helping them become a more well-rounded and versatile artist.

While StuyCanvas aims to facilitate the growth of one’s technical abilities as well as encourage the creation of artwork, StuyCanvas hopes that members can inspire one another. StuyCanvas will give Stuyvesant students a platform to collaborate, request constructive criticism, and support each other in the members' artistic explorations. Many club activities will encourage active teamwork and discussion. Whether it be a group free-draw session, or a peer-led workshop, the club hopes that members can benefit from each other’s unique experiences and insights. 

StuyCanvas is a wonderful place to create for yourself, and not necessarily worry about polished, finished products. The club encourages you to improve at your own pace and become a better artist with every meeting.
",https://www.instagram.com/stuycanvas/ ,"There are currently three co-leaders in charge of organizing meetings/events and communicating with external organizations and the rest of StuyCanvas. Applications for leadership positions will open up towards the end of the Spring Semester. This will consist of both a written application and an interview, both of which will be considered by all currently sitting co-leaders, as well as Ms. Chu. While underclassmen are preferred for leadership positions, anyone is free to apply.

StuyCanvas aims to keep StuyCanvas a comfortable and welcoming space for everybody involved. Racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexual harassment, and all forms of degrading speech will not be tolerated. Any member that is witness/subject to this treatment is highly encouraged to speak to a co-president or Ms. Chu. An additional google form is set up such that members can report incidents anonymously. Violating members will be spoken to – depending on severity, they may receive a warning and/or be removed outright. If a President is at risk of being cut, they'll be called to have a discussion with the other President and Ms. Chu. In the case that the President is terminated from their position, another will be appointed by the same methods outlined above.

StuyCanvas is low-commitment, and the club will generally be lenient if members cannot make certain meetings or contribute to every activity. However, there will be a reasonable expectation that an effort is made to be engaged with the ongoings of the club. Any member that consistently fails to show up/participate may be removed.
","StuyCanvas is the only visual arts club that places a strong focus on improving the technical art skills of each individual member, rather than simply hosting a space to create art. Members will be actively learning and furthering their artistic tool kit during each meeting. The club also provides a community that allows members to learn directly from peers and build valuable connections with other artists, whether that be through peer-led lessons or through collaborative activities. ","StuyCanvas meetings will typically happen on Wednesdays, and there will be 1-2 meetings every month. External events may be arranged outside of school hours.

NBA Club,NBA,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/NBA/38ee08a0,"The Stuyvesant NBA Club seeks to provide the students of Stuyvesant a welcoming space for the lovers of the National Basketball Association.
","The purpose of this organization, the NBA (National Basketball Association) club, is to provide a welcoming space for the Stuyvesant students who love to watch basketball and desire to discuss it with those who equally love the game. Members of the club will discuss league news, games, and rumors. Members will also watch highlights, old games and analyze games. Every Friday members of the club will play trivia games such as jeopardy, Sporcle, and Kahoot. The groups that win the trivia games will be given prizes based on a points system. The meetings of the club will take place every Thursday and Friday. Members of the club are expected to attend at least one of the days and may contribute to making trivia games about the National Basketball Association if they wish to do so. Watching and discussing basketball is a hobby for many and the NBA Club desires to connect people with the same hobbies and interests with each other. Joining the NBA Club does not require proficient knowledge about the NBA. Those who are passionate to learn more about the NBA can join the NBA Club.
","The National Basketball Association Club will benefit the Stuyvesant community in a plethora of ways. Firstly, those that love the NBA and those who wish to learn more about the NBA will be able to foster friendships through a common interest. A discussion requires multiple people and through these discussions, members can make friendships that could last a long time. Secondly, the National Basketball Association Club will provide members a stress-free environment where members can relax and catch up with friends. Members will be able to relax by doing what they love which is important after a long and rigorous day of school because the environment of Stuyvesant can be both emotionally and physically straining. Thirdly, the National Basketball Association Club will help members learn more about the National Basketball Association and basketball as a whole. Playing trivia games will sharpen our members’ knowledge about the game and more knowledge can only benefit members since knowledge is power. Most importantly, the NBA club will provide a welcoming and warm environment for many people whether they love basketball, are a casual fan of sports, or even want to get into watching basketball and understanding the game. As Michael Jordan once said, ""Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. The NBA club desires to make friendships happen!
",,"There are three leadership positions and a board for the NBA Club. The positions include president, vice president, and secretary. The leaders are expected to participate in every meeting, contribute to the club’s organizations and plans, help in activities and meetings, and make up the Trivia games that will be played every Friday. Leaders that do not follow the rules and don’t provide a valid explanation for not following the rules will be impeached via a board decision. The majority or at least 60% of members will be required to vote to remove a leader. The appointment of future leaders and a future board will be determined by an application process. Members that wish to apply will be sent a Google Form and answer a few questions. If they are selected by our board, then they will be interviewed. The basic requirements for a leadership position are active participation, knowledge of the NBA, and contribution to the club while a member. We all aim to foster a community in which we can enrich our knowledge of the NBA and discuss games.
","The NBA (National Basketball Association) club is unique because there are not many clubs in the Stuyvesant Clubs and Pubs that allow students to discuss the National Basketball Association and play trivia games. The NBA club provides students who do not wish to play in the basketball team or join the Basketball Club to discuss the National Basketball Association and play trivial games such as jeopardy. The club does not require any physical activity like other sports clubs and is great for NBA fans that desire to talk about the game of basketball than playing it.
","The meetings for the NBA Club are scheduled every Friday, at least three times a month.

We will be studying famous historical battles, ranging from D-Day to Thermopylae. We will also learn about important tactics, including but not limited to defeating in detail, envelopment, committing the reserve, or shock actions. And to top it off, we will host speakers and play table-top war games to help students understand how ancient armies and modernized militaries engage in combat, taking into account differences in technology ranging from weaponry to logistical equipment. Members will also be expected to have a positive attitude and remember that the entire point of this club is to have some fun and destress during the busy week at Stuy, not turn it into an actual life or death scenario.
","Stuyvesant has always had a wide variety of clubs. There's always something for everyone. However, this is a niche that still has yet to be filled. It provides something fun for Stuyvesant students to do during the week that's just a little bit unique. It will allow student to hone their critical thinking skills, as well as open up new patterns of thinking. Through studying these ancient battles, students get to put themselves in the shoes of historic generals and legendary figures, and see if they would make the same decisions. Stuyvesant students may be able to gain insight into current world affairs involving military action, and allow them to better understand the geopolitical landscape through the lenses of a commander. Additionally, the Stuyvesant school week can be ridiculously stressful, so this club just provides another way for students to relax and destress after a challenging day.

The matter is then to be voted upon, where two-thirds or more or more of the club's members must agree that the president is no longer deserving of the role and should be impeached.

There will be meetings once a month to check in on progress, and teachers will be expected to log their lessons. At the end of the year, there will be a concert to showcase the students. Our purpose is to introduce students to classical/contemporary instrumental music who may not have had much prior experience, provide lessons for students who may not have access to them elsewhere, and create a community for all students who have an interest in music. Chamber music groups may also be considered for the prestigious Lincoln Center chamber music competition.","This activity will benefit any students who may not have previously had access to instrumental lessons.

There will be a number of performances throughout the year where students can practice their craft as soloists or as part of a chamber music group. The club will be a creative space for all students to learn and express themselves. It will also benefit audiences at Stuy, who will get a chance to support their peers in performances and be exposed to more types of music. The outreach concerts at elementary schools and senior centers will benefit other audiences of different age groups as well, inspiring them with music performances and bringing light and hope into their lives.

Stuyvesant Women Engineers,swe,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/swe/80257015,SWE creates a space for female and non-binary students to pursue the field of engineering.,"Only 15% of people working in engineering occupations in 2019 were women. Stuyvesant Women Engineers elevates young women at Stuy in fields of engineering to close this gender disparity and create a space for female and non-binary students to unapologetically study engineering. Club meetings involve engineering lessons taught by fellow students and advised by Stuyvesant teachers. Topics range from a variety of engineering disciplines, such as civil engineering, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering. Club members are able to engage in hands-on experiments, like building bridges out of popsicle sticks and building miniature circuits, to apply their knowledge in math and science.

Stuyvesant’s Women Engineering club also provides resources for pursuing engineering in college and as a career. Through college prep lessons and speaker panels of female engineers, members can develop their knowledge on what a career in engineering might look like as well as how to get there. Each meeting has at least 2 student leaders present to administer lessons or activities, and help from any of the student leaders will always be available through email.

Stuyvesant Women Engineers encourages all young women and non-binary people to explore their interest in engineering, a field in which their identities are a drastic minority.","SWE targets a specific audience to benefit the Stuyvesant community. They work to develop a well-rounded and more in-depth education in engineering at Stuyvesant by highlighting voices and perspectives from the minority. Speaker events and weekly lessons increase students’ experience in the field of engineering, and create a safer space for women and non-binary students to study this field. SWE aims to create a greater interest in engineering for women in Stuyvesant, hoping to inspire the next female engineers, inventors, and architects.

SWE’s mission is to bring more women and non-binary individuals into the engineering field in college and in the professional world. Despite everything, SWE brings awareness to the scarce amount of women actively pursuing engineering occupations and fights for greater female representation and gender equality in engineering and the world of STEM.

Academically, SWE strengthens students’ engagement in their core classes at Stuyvesant, including physics, calculus, and even history, by applying their principles to experiments in their strategizing and planning. This activity serves as motivation for students in their academic careers and may finally answer the question, “when will I actually use this in real life?”

Additionally, an increased interest in engineering overall increases Stuyvesant’s participation in other engineering competitions. This interest upkeeps the STEM-heavy reputation of Stuyvesant and builds girls’ confidence in the Stuyvesant community by earning their place to represent the school.",find all of our info here! --> https://linktr.ee/stuywe,"The leadership positions are President, Vice President, Teacher, and Community Organizer. The President must oversee all aspects of the club, and is responsible for curating the year’s curriculum, contributing to lesson plans, organizing activities and activity materials, and keeping track of other people’s progress within Stuyvesant Women Engineers. The Vice President supports all of the responsibilities of the President and serves as a second voice for the President. The Vice President must also contribute to lesson plans and keep track of other people’s progress, keeping the club in check and on task. Teachers are responsible for creating the bulk of the lesson plans and activities, involving each Teacher’s own research and creativity. Teachers work with other Teachers to divide up the work evenly each week. Community Organizers are responsible for creating outreach events for the club and reaching out to professionals and organizations for such events.

Prior knowledge of linguistics is not required. We will also make space each week to practice at least one problem for the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO). The concept of computational linguistics might be foreign to many, but problems on the NACLO can be thought of as linguistics related logic puzzles. As the test date approaches, we will spend more time reviewing practice problems, discussing tips for the test, and solving practice problems as a group. Students who do well in the open round of the NACLO will have an opportunity to take part in the invitational round with the greater goal of having the chance to represent the US in the International Linguistics Olympiad. Taking the NACLO is not required for participation in the Stuyvesant Linguistics Club. ","The Stuyvesant Linguistics Club gives Stuyvesant students the ability to learn about linguistics, a rich and diverse subject not commonly taught in high school, and to experience the ideas that the field has to offer. The club will spread awareness about what linguistics is, what linguists do, and why the field is important. We also aim to clear up misconceptions about linguistics as a subject. Although language is central to our daily lives, few people understand its inner workings and how it is used. Linguistics covers how our speech sounds are produced and combined to make words, how different languages form words and sentences with different structure, and how meaning is conveyed, among other things. The subject is relevant to and draws from psychology, sociology, computer science, math, neuroscience, philosophy, and other areas of study. We will educate the Stuyvesant community while giving students a place to have fun and discuss interesting topics. 

We also plan to discuss NACLO problems, which are unique puzzles requiring logical thinking, deductive reasoning, and creativity. We will give students an easy way to access the competition and an avenue to practice and work on problems with other students. Stuyvesant has performed well on the NACLO in the past and we hope to continue this trend. ",,"Since the Stuyvesant Linguistics Club is currently very small, the main leadership role is president. The president role will be split into two co-presidents. Presidents for the following year will be selected in June of the prior school year. The qualifications for leadership are consistent participation in club meetings, familiarity with the NACLO (taking the test is recommended but not required), and demonstrated enthusiasm for linguistics. Presidents are expected to lead discussions and plan weekly activities. Presidents should be receptive and flexible to club member’s desires to learn about certain topics. Presidents are not expected to be experts in linguistics, we’re high school students after all, but they should be able to point club members in the right direction (i.e a trusted online source). In the event that club members or the faculty advisor believe that one of the presidents is not doing their job, for the remainder of the year or semester, the lasting president may appoint a club member to be the acting co-president. In the event both presidents are not doing their jobs, an emergency vote will be held to determine new leaders.","The Stuyvesant Linguistics Club is the only club at Stuyvesant to focus on linguistics and the NACLO competition. We aim to provide a well rounded introduction to linguistics. In the past there has been a club solely focused on NACLO preparation which has since dissolved after its leaders graduated. We seek to build on this former club by adding a deep non-test prep linguistics component.

Stuyvesant Genshin Club,sgic,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/sgic/e76e33ce,"The Stuyvesant Genshin Impact Club aims to connect and destress students through Genshin Impact, an open-world RPG with gacha elements.
","In the Stuyvesant Genshin Impact Club, we wish to introduce students to the wonderful world of gacha gaming, specifically Genshin Impact. Genshin Impact is a game with high-quality graphics, attractive characters, and a compelling storyline (though they have not progressed the main storyline in about half a year). In SGIC, students can seek advice from other members about their character build or simply ask questions about the structure of this game. Students who join this club will be expected to simply attend meets once a week and co-op with other members. Members are also expected to be willing to give out their UIDs. Since this is mainly a fun club for students to enjoy playing Genshin Impact with new friends, even people who have never played Genshin but are interested in it are welcome to join. In SGIC, we will also participate in the Genshin Impact Content Creators program, in which players can earn primos (the in-game currency for gacha pulling). 
","Genshin Impact is a relatively casual game, so it really lets students destress. Furthermore, because of the cooperative aspects of the game, students can easily make connections with each other while interacting with each other in-game. This is especially important given the current pandemic since most students are stuck at home without opportunities to meet and befriend new people. Additionally, participating in this club can allow students to grow other skill sets. For example, Genshin Impact has a Content Creators program, where players can draw, produce videos, or stream for in-game rewards. Members who decide to participate in this program will not only find friends, but also an opportunity to experience what it’s like to creatively express themselves. Another example is that, for players that would like to min-max their gaming experience, members can do damage calculations and such to find out how to best play their favorite characters, thus putting to use math skills that would otherwise go unused in everyday life. Adding on, the world of Genshin Impact, though perhaps not at first glance, is rather complicated, allowing players to analyze the information available to them to create theories on aspects of the world. Students who are interested in this aspect of the game will be able to learn how to connect ideas and analyze texts. Finally, Genshin Impact is first and foremost a gacha game. By playing such games, students are able to learn how to better manage their currencies in order to get the characters they want; resource management is a crucial skill, and, through this club, students can learn it.
",https://discord.gg/eZG7DQd47Y,"Members will be given leadership positions on the basis of organizational skill, time management, and their enthusiasm for the club, not by their level of experience in the game itself. We plan on filling the roles of president, vice president and secretary as well as non-organizational roles in damage calculation and lore analysis. This club is currently centered around three presidents, who helped found the club, but future generations of students may vote for fewer presidents. Thus, the hierarchy is not rigid but can change to suit the needs of the club members. These elections will be held on Discord. Members will be expected to follow the rules detailed in the Discord server and be respectful to other members at all times. If more than 60% of the members at any given time wish to impeach the president or other leadership positions, the student in that position will be impeached and a replacement to be voted on by the rest of the club; however, the member that was impeached will still be able to be a general member of the club and apply for future elections. 
","Currently, there aren’t any other clubs that are centered around gacha games, so we will be bringing a new world of entertainment to Stuyvesant. Additionally, unlike other gacha games, Genshin Impact is an open-world game with co-op features, which allows and encourages collaboration between members. Furthermore, Genshin Impact encourages a variety of other activities, like drawing, making videos, doing advanced calculations, and theorizing. We hope that, through this club, students will be able to gain experiences in a variety of these other activities.
","Our meeting schedule will definitely vary, but we aim to meet at least once a week on Mondays, because that is when weekly aspects of the game reset. There may be more meetings when there are events, especially those that encourage co-op, and when there are new banners, so that all members can celebrate when new characters are available.

","Being an informed citizen often means having a nuanced understanding of different issues and forming opinions on them. However, without outside perspectives, it is easy for one to become trapped in an echo chamber. Political Stuy-ence aims to provide a safe space to explore different political philosophies by learning about the works of Western political philosophers such as Locke, discussing morally-provoking questions, and participating in fun activities. Members will explore how different philosophies shaped the founding of the United States and how they continue to influence policy creation to this day. The club will allow members to consider difficult questions and multiple perspectives, allowing them to recognize their ideals as well as biases and, by extension, gain a deeper understanding of themselves. The club is a perfect starting point for people who want to have a better idea of different political philosophies, to form their own, and/or reinforce already existing ones. 
","While Stuyvesant has many engaging classes regarding politics or civics, students sometimes don’t feel comfortable expressing their opinions knowing there is a grade attached. Political Stuy-ence helps alleviate this pressure by providing the Stuyvesant community with an opportunity to explore political science in a judgment-free environment. The club provides comprehensive lessons on different political philosophies while allowing members space to develop their own beliefs through open-ended discussions and fun activities. In the process, members will explore questions such as whether humans are inherently good, why people form governments, how governments should govern, how to balance opposing interests in policy formation, and more. Other topics that will be explored include game theory and how it relates to formation of economic policy, the political philosophies that influenced the founding documents, and the different ways the social contract is interpreted. By the end of the school year, members will have gained knowledge of different political philosophies as well as form their own philosophy and, by extension, better understand themselves. Members will also develop various invaluable skills such as being able to form convincing arguments, communicating effectively, and critical thinking. Additionally, the club provides opportunities to meet new people, and potentially new friends, by discussing complex issues in a relaxed atmosphere. 
",,"A month before the end of the school year, the co-presidents will appoint their successors from a pool of applicants based on demonstrated interest and past dedication.

At the beginning of the school year, the co-presidents will appoint a curriculum manager and an outreach coordinator. The curriculum manager is responsible for planning club activities such as lessons and games to be used during club meetings. The outreach coordinator is responsible for communicating with members through email and Facebook posts as well as being a point of contact for any general inquiries.The co-presidents and curriculum manager should have a strong understanding of different political philosophies or are willing to dedicate time to learning. If a majority of club members feel that any leader is unfit for the position, a vote will be taken to remove them from office. Should the vote succeed, there will be an election held for the position.
","Political Stuy-ence is unique in that it is one of the few clubs dedicated to allowing members to learn about different political philosophies.

The Metis Project,metis,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/metis/7049f038,The Metis Project is an enrichment service focused on providing free tutoring to various communities in NYC.,"The Metis Project (Metis) is a tutoring organization that aims to provide free tutoring services to any and all families. The Metis Project hopes to provide students with a safe environment outside of the classroom where they can learn. The Metis Project has flexibility and dedication in delivering what suits the (tutee) students best. In the coming school year of 2022-2023, The Metis Project will aim to provide general assistance and subject-specific lessons for those who sign up. Tutors will be paired with tutees (in classes of 1 on 1 or group as needed) based on what subjects that the tutor has indicated proficiency in and will have the option of working in person or from home to form personal connections and gain experience. Tutors are expected to meet the tutee on the designated time (that is agreed upon by both parties). Although tutors do not need to have a lesson plan, it is recommended for a lesson plan to be created (or borrowed) for subject-specific lessons/classes. The Metis Project has slides created by prior tutors in the summer that can be borrowed for certain classes as the tutors see fit. There are also ESL and SHSAT preparatory classes offered by The Metis Project that tutors can participate in.
","The Metis Project was originally only active during the summer, as it granted both tutors and tutees time to prepare and attend the sessions. However, this year, The Metis Project is attempting to reach out and try this fall for a different style. The Metis Project is planning on doing a fall-spring session to help those in younger grades have academic support(general classes), and if their parents wish, additional (academic) classes. The tutor-tutee pairings will be done based on both parties' available times and wants. Doing this, The Metis Project hopes to give the tutors volunteer experience that doesn't impact their schedule much (as they can choose the time). Although The Metis Project doesn't just have tutors in Stuyvesant, by offering this experience, The Metis Project provides opportunities to Stuyvesant students to improve their leadership, patience, and creativity, all the while helping their communities in NYC. Additionally, the act of teaching someone who is younger, and of a different grade, Stuyvesant students may be able to de-stress from the competitiveness of the overall Stuyvesant culture. Furthermore, tutors may be able to gain valuable communication skills through teaching in such a way that others can understand. Although it is still in an academic environment, The Metis Project believes that it would benefit students to teach.",metisproject.org,"The Metis Project has 1 President, 3 Vice Presidents (various roles), Webmasters (as needed), department heads (of ESL, and SHSAT prep), IT admin, Social Media Manager, and admins as needed. The procedure for applying to a leadership position is to first apply to become an admin (interview). Those that display proactive work and dedication to the program may be offered a position by an existing member of administration. After that, if there is need for more positions (opened up either through impeachment or direct removal due to misconduct/willing resignation) there will be nominations and voting from other admins. Those that wish to aim for a higher position may give speeches and arguments in a debate on a date determined by the Vice President. Impeachment is decided through weighted arguments from the impeachment-in-progress-nominee, and will be judged by the President and Vice Presidents. Other impeachments (higher positions) will be decided by the President along with other admins (voting).
The President will be decided by the previous year Vice Presidents and President. Vice Presidents will be determined when the ones in said position resign/impeached. As The Metis Project is to be run by high school students, the positions will determine their successor before they leave for higher education/work.","The Metis Project fosters a community of tutors from various high schools around NYC and connects them. As a student run organization, it is solely run by students, and this allows them to add their own flair. As The Metis Project is based on one on one tutoring and pairing is done based on both tutor and tutee preferences, tutors are free to teach as they like, and when they like, to better suit the tutee. ","The meeting schedule varies from month to month, as the tutor meets independently with the tutee, but can range anywhere from 1 meeting a month, to multiple a week. However, meetings for the admin team are more often. Meetings with all the tutors may happen once or twice a semester.",['monday'],medium,"['metis', 'tutoring', 'club']","The Metis Project is run by high school students at various high schools in NYC.

StuyTV,STV,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/STV/358d8ba3,StuyTV aims to organize and film a variety of video genres of Stuy life. ,"The purpose of StuyTV is to provide students with an interest in both filmmaking and cinematography a platform to express their inner creativity. The club aims to provide the resources and educate those with the basics of filmmaking while viewing the works of famous directors (eg. Leila Conners, Fisher Stevens, etc.). Throughout each meeting StuyTV will separate days for learning the methods of film production used by others while other days will be used for filming. Members will be able to create props, write scripts, help with editing, and filming. Key to this club is the ability for management and coordination of projects making sure to orderly maneuver tasks ensuring that all bases are covered for a final product in our documentaries. The club aims to provide students abroad a view within Stuyvesant that encapsulates the energy and creativity of its people. StuyTV aims to capture the aspects of the day to day lifestyle of Stuyvesant students and the obstacles Stuy students face on a day to day basis. Joining StuyTV will provide members a wider perspective of stuy life. 
","The plan for this club, StuyTV, is to uncover the inner creativity of our members and to really bring out the imagination behind the films. StuyTV will be using the limited supplies StuyTV has now to craft documentation of Stuy life. Each meeting will include viewing a bit of a documentary and taking notes of creative techniques used by these directors to hook the viewer into watching more. Then, StuyTV will provide students with roles for which they would use to improve and grasp in order to put their very best in their work into our video projects. Documentation has provided people all over the world a way to see within the lives of others across the world, this club will be able to achieve similar results but within the school environment. These documentaries will include stuy life as well as issues abroad that affect Stuy. No prior experience in film making will at all be required as leaders and members alike will go through this journey together in order to harness their creativity inside to passionately/collaboratively make documentaries. StuyTV is also planning on collaborating with other Stuyvesant clubs to give them a new medium on which they can advertise their clubs.
",https://discord.gg/2eDHs3nPNh,"Leadership will be appointed by the prior leaders. The leadership positions will be decided through application and voting/overall consensus between the leaders. The (Co) Presidents will manage all aspects of the clubs coordinations, operations, and production while managing the team members on their tasks. The (Co) Presidents will be tasked to help members through lesson plans, slides, scheduled meetings, and planning. The president will be selected based on their knowledge and understanding of what it means to lead/communicate with a large group of members on their team. They will also be tasked with recruiting new members, creating/distributing flyers, promoting the club, and updating/managing the clubs social media accounts. The faculty advisor will be able to give advice on the selection of the new leaders in order to keep the aim of the club in focus years after the very first leaders have left. Leaders can be impeached if they are found by a simple majority to be unfair, uncooperative, or unproductive. To start the impeachment of a leader, a member must approach another leader to start a vote. The member in question who starts the vote will have their identity kept confidential in case of retaliation. If retaliation does occur after the leader manages to stay a leader, the leader can be impeached without a vote.","StuyTV covers a variety of videographic styles and topics, making us a club based upon improving and producing videos of all sorts.

Unlike the other film clubs, we will actually be producing and releasing said films rather than just learning to make them. It is also unique in the fact that it encompasses the entire spectrum of film production from acting, set design, and videography to directing.

	Stuyvesant Artistic Beading Club (Stuy ABC) aims to introduce students to the art of beading and develop their creativity through making 3D models. ","Stuy ABC’s purpose is to spread the hobby of beading to a wider audience. The process of beading 3D models includes connecting beads with string to produce rings that will be combined to form the final model and different patterns are targeted to each model. We will be using acrylic faceted beads of sizes 4-10 mm to make models, such as lanterns, pumpkins, clovers, cubes, stars, etc. For COVID safety, we will be distributing materials in ziploc bags whenever members want to start a new model. Every week, we will send out a Facebook poll deciding what to do at each meeting. For certain weeks, mentors will be teaching new models in groups; members will also be given the chance to work on their own models in other weeks. The models mentors will be teaching will be decided through Facebook polls as well. Ultimately, our goal is for members to be able to make models on their own by following completed models. During holidays, we hope to host fundraisers and members are expected to contribute at least one model they made to the fundraisers. No experience is necessary!
","In Stuy ABC, members will be able to relax from a stressful day and express their creativity through experimenting with new models. We aim to foster a friendly community to make new friends, connect with old friends, share interests, chill, and be proud of our own work. Completed models can be taken home and having a collection of beaded crafts provides not only a sense of accomplishment, but also a lasting memory of Stuy. Since there are a variety of bead colors, members can explore their creativity by using different combinations of colors, or even coming up with their own models! We will also be showcasing models made by our members on our Instagram account. On holidays such as Christmas or Valentine’s Day, members can also make holiday-oriented models (such as candy canes and hearts) as gifts or decorations for their family/friends. Furthermore, if allowed, there will be many opportunities throughout the year to cooperate with leaders in fundraising activities where the money earned will be donated to charities or back to the school. There will be meetings where members will be working in groups as well, which helps foster new bonds and friendships in same or different grade levels. Our mentors will be there to guide the way from simpler to more complicated models.
",https://instagram.com/stuyabc?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= ,"Leadership positions will be appointed based on applications. StuyABC will be run by two co-presidents and several mentors. New co-presidents will be chosen based on their dedication, contributions, and leadership skills before the current presidents graduate. Co-presidents will be expected to oversee all leadership roles, manage funding, and teach members. Candidates for co-president are also required to be mentors before they can apply to become co-presidents. New co-presidents will be selected once the current co-presidents graduate. Mentors are expected to help out and guide members in the process of making models. Applications to become a mentor will be sent out at the start of every semester and new mentors will be chosen based on their participation, skill level, and availability. However, leaders and mentors will be impeached if they constantly skip meetings or disrespect others (bullying or assault in any form). Our faculty advisor will be notified and current leaders will discuss the final decision of either impeachment or suspension.
","Stuy ABC is the only club at Stuy that uses beads as the primary material to make arts and crafts. The only materials needed are string and beads, and the models will be formed by repeatedly looping the string after the desired number of beads has been added. You can also make a variety of models through beading, ranging from animals to accessories (keychains, decorations for bags, etc) to name plates. Once members start making more complicated models, they will be able to identify various patterns in beading, and potentially come up with their own models.
","We will be meeting once per week on Monday, but may be adjusted according to school closings.

This club helps members learn Chinese, since the original game is in Chinese, and most of the members will probably be Chinese. But this is in no way a limitation for non Chinese speakers because we also have an English version of the game. This club also develop strategical thinking and team work skills as this is a strategy game at core, it also has a team/side feature where people have to work together to bring the other teams down. Since Sanguosha has a lot of historical elements in it, it can be a place of discussion for those who are interested in Ancient Chinese History. The club also aims to introduce other equally fun and niche games to the members in order to broaden their sights as well as having a good time. The nicheness of sanguosha makes this game really obscure to American high schoolers, so this club aims to get as many people as possible to at least get to know this game. The general members are expect to help achieve the club's purpose and just have as much fun as possible.","This club will benefit the Stuyvesant community greatly. First of all, this club focuses on playing a card game, which is one of the best tools for entertainment. Stuyvesant students are often overworked, sleep-deprived, and stressed, this club provides a way for long time players of sanguosha to wind down after a long day, or for new players to get their mind off things by learning a complicated game. Of course, why can't they just play other games? Most teenagers play video games, that isn't that big of a deal, but having time off of screen and playing some good ol card games really helps with the widespread issues mentioned before. One of the most popular world language courses in Stuyvesant is Mandarin, which is the main language this game uses(it also has english versions so dont worry), the members of this club will likely be fluent already and they will be able to assist other members who aren't fluent to become better at the language. This game incorporates a lot of ancient chinese history, so it is also a great game for those who likes to geek about ancient chinese history, or people who just wants to learn mroe about ancient chinese history.",https://discord.gg/2sRqsgCPzR,"The leadership positions are 1.President, 2.Co-President(s), and 3.

Stuyvesant DECA emphasizes teamwork and cooperation. Some competitions and activities in club meetings may be individual interviews or presentations while others may be collaborative group projects.

","DECA will work to benefit the Stuyvesant community in a multitude of ways. Therefore, DECA would benefit the Stuyvesant community by providing a medium for individuals to explore specific business related interests that were not available to them through current clubs. Additionally, DECA helps the Stuyvesant student body by shortening the gap between the real-world and school, providing important experience. While still important, the skills students learn in school have a much more indirect effect on their lives; DECA would provide the most straightforward way of learning career-specific skills that are necessary for success outside of the classroom. DECA is a diverse program with an extensive variety of competitions. It is a competitive program that aids students in many ways, such as building confidence, developing leadership, encouraging scholarship and school loyalty, facilitating the transition from school to work, developing management skills, and lastly developing character as a whole. Those that succeed in the DECA competitions would enhance their portfolio for future opportunities. It is vital to provide and inform students of every opportunity possible. Thus, Stuyvesant DECA will actively benefit the Stuyvesant community, with this mix of competition and learning, that can be utilized both in the classroom and in the real world.

The primary focus will be going over all the topics covered on the USNCO which overlaps almost entirely with a first-year general chemistry course. However, the material will be taught at a level slightly above the AP Chemistry curriculum. To supplement these lessons, question sets will be provided with worked solutions so that members can practice the skills they learn. These lessons and these problem sets will support the club’s purpose of helping more students pursue their enjoyment of chemistry. This will help combat the learning curve of chemistry as well.

Ultimately, the purpose of StuyChem is to facilitate students’ interest in chemistry and to spread more interest in chemistry by providing the support they need to excel in the subject.","When new members join the club, they will be immersed in a supportive community with a passion in chemistry. Weekly lessons will cover material taught in chemistry classes at Stuy. This will aid all students, those that are struggling in their chemistry classes and those who are looking for further educational material and resources. Lessons will also prepare students for competitive chemistry through extensive problem sets. These resources will reinforce skills learned. For students struggling in the subject, leaders of the club are more than willing to invest time and resources to aid them.

Additionally, the competitive chemistry club creates a tight-knit environment for people that want to expand their knowledge of chemistry. This can be incredibly beneficial to underclassmen looking to learn more about chemistry but are not given the classes to increase their knowledge. This can also be incredibly beneficial to upperclassmen looking to spread their knowledge of chemistry and their passion for the subject.

Stuy Spirituality,stuyspirituality,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyspirituality/ec0b1b26,"Stuy Spirituality is all about self-improvement, meditation, mindfulness, and community. ","Stuy Spirituality is a low-commitment club which hosts meditation and discussion sessions once a week. The purpose of this club is to spread knowledge throughout the student body about the concepts encompassed by spirituality, such as meditation. Meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that are intended to encourage a heightened state of awareness and focused attention, thereby improving quality of life. Meditation is also a consciousness-changing technique that has been proven by countless sources to have many positive effects on psychological well-being. Some benefits include a long-lasting sense of calm, peace, and balance that can even help you manage symptoms of certain medical conditions. Along with opportunities for group meditations during every meeting, we also discuss various topics such as chakras, kundalini techniques, crystals, yoga, spiritual awakenings, and even how to raise your vibration. Spirituality encompasses many concepts from Hinduism, Buddhism, and other belief systems; one thing that they all have in common is the concept of ""energy of creation,"" or the driving force inside of us to keep on going. This ""energy of creation,"" whether you call it prana, kundalini, brahman, etc., can be activated rapidly and misused by those who are not spiritually motivated or those who have not completed the meditative process. Completing this process by meditating regularly to open your mind will set you free of your personal patterns or negative tendencies. It is absolutely crucial to understand the process and intention of your own energy of creation or life force as it awakens you to the discovery of wisdom, love, and authentic direction in your own life. Through this club, we find simplicity, contentment, unconditional acceptance, presence, and detachment together. Whether you barely know how to meditate or already do it daily, absolutely anyone who is interested is welcome to join Stuy Spirituality!! One of the main goals for this club is to establish a welcoming community with a positive space for learning, so everyone is encouraged to join regardless of ability or knowledge.","Stuy Spirituality brings physical, mental, and emotional well-being to the student body through spiritual education. Our weekly meditation sessions reduce stress, pain, and anxiety while also improving emotional balance and increasing focus, creativity, and memory. Meditation has also been proven to help gain new perspectives on stressful situations, build stress management skills, increase self-awareness, and stabilize one's focus on the present moment. Additionally, the occasional yoga sessions we organize improve flexibility, strength, and even sleep quality. Besides all of the obvious benefits of spiritual practices, the sense of community that we create in this club is an amazing environment to learn in. This is a safe, judgement-free space for members to share anything that has helped them on their spiritual journey. This club acts as an information hub for any meditation techniques, interesting articles, books, spiritual ideas, etc., that you would like to share with your curious peers. Lastly, this club was originally established with the idea of self-improvement in mind, and it will guaranteed improve every aspect of your health, whether it be physical, mental, social, or emotional! Everyone needs a bit of a de-stressor sometimes, especially in a school like Stuy. Meditation is a great first step to take in building a new, improved, and less-stressed version of yourself.

Leadership positions will be appointed based on commitment and dedication to the growing education platform of our club and preservation of our safe and spiritual community.

If a leader wants to forgo their position, their wishes will be respected, regardless of their reason to leave.

The spiritual journey to self-awareness and a high vibration is a very difficult one, so this club is here to simply provide guidance to those who need it. This club exposes members to such a wide variety of topics that all students, regardless of preference or ability, can be included and have an opportunity to learn about spirituality. Through this club, we are able to educate the Stuy community about bettering themselves in simple ways, step-by-step, so they can ultimately become the best versions of themselves.

","Have you ever wondered about the science of drug use in humans? Stuy Pharmacy will answer your question! Our club acknowledges the importance of pharmacists and their role in the medical field. Pharmacists work alongside health professionals to provide medication and expertise concerning the health of patients. Stuy Pharmacy hopes to ignite and encourage interest in the field of pharmacy through educational discussions, presentations, and group activities related to the field. The topics to be discussed will pertain to studies in clinical pharmacology, molecular and cellular pharmacology, and psychopharmacology. Interesting examples include the evolution (history) of pharmacy, common antibiotics and house drugs, pharmacy school, and the job of a pharmacist. Topic suggestions and ideas are welcome from all members. As Stuy Pharmacy is committed to teaching pharmacology, we hope to collaborate with other clubs to raise awareness about drugs. Members of the club will gain a meaningful experience while exploring the depths of pharmacology and the opportunities offered in a fast-changing and vital field of medicine. In addition, members of the club will be able to analyze case studies and hopefully do virtual labs (simulations). This organization will try its best to accommodate everyone's busy schedule but all members are expected to attend meetings.","Stuy Pharmacy will serve to promote student interest in STEM fields. Students interested in or planning to pursue the study of pharmacology are welcome to participate and contribute to our club. Furthermore, students with an interest or those aspiring to become pharmacists must have outstanding communication and interpretational skills. Stuy Pharmacy will cater to these students by providing a platform where they can observe, share their knowledge, and make connections. Members of the club will gain a multitude of skills and develop a scientific attitude as they learn about the biological and chemical components of pharmacology, analyze case studies, and discuss the moral ethics of science. When possible, leaders of the club will look out for and share any open opportunities in the medical field so that members can apply and strengthen their knowledge of pharmacology. In addition, if club members need additional help understanding the pathways (human organ systems), the biological molecules of life, or any related topic necessary to understanding the basics of pharmacology, Stuy Pharmacy will offer advice or tutoring to strengthen the understanding of the particular topic. Stuy Pharmacy is a low-commitment club fostering curiosity and scientific thinking. Being part of this club will be a rewarding experience.
",https://www.facebook.com/groups/stuypharmacy/,"All club members will be given an equal opportunity to apply for leadership positions. The presidents in charge will conduct interviews after reviewing each application. Once a leadership board is established, the existing leaders will have the final decision in future appointments of the club leaders. If a member of the leadership team graduates, resigns or quits, the remaining leaders will vote on a candidate to take the open spot. If the president(s) graduates, resigns or quits, ownership of the club will be passed onto member(s) of the leadership board. Impeachments can be suggested by any of the club members or faculty advisors. A consensus form will be created and if more than half the club agrees, then it will be discussed between the leadership board and faculty advisor.

Stuy CyberSec,CyberSec,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/CyberSec/a0469e5d,Stuy CyberSec provides a community where students can explore cybersecurity with their peers.,"Stuy CyberSec is a space for students to learn about many aspects of cybersecurity. In a standard meeting, members will quickly learn about or review a topic and engage in challenges to strengthen their understanding of that topic. Although we encourage competitiveness, we strive to maintain a safe, risk-free space where members can experiment and branch outside of their comfort zone. We also provide resources for our members who want to explore certain areas further. Throughout the year, members will have the chance to participate in various competitions, like CTFs, where members can put their knowledge and problem solving skills to the test and earn substantial prizes for placing high. For members with prior experience that are willing to invest more time, a team of students will be participating in Cyberpatriots, a competition hosted by the US Air Force. The bottom line is that this is a club meant to have fun and to learn!
","How will this activity benefit the Stuyvesant community? (200-400)
Cybersecurity is a fast growing field, and Stuy CyberSec aims to set students up to excel in it. Members gain insight into the many ways hackers may try to exploit systems, which can prevent us from falling victim to it. Members will also get the chance to develop their problem solving skills by learning how they can better protect themselves online. These skills range from being able to protect oneself from scams and phishing attacks, to be able to stop tracking and intercept websites . We teach members the ins and outs of internet safety, and the methods hackers use to exploit users. Another area we hope to explore are the types of attack and malicious ploys that black-hat hackers might use to try to exploit systems. This could be SQL injection, viruses, such as RATs and keyloggers, or even bitcoin miners. We will also do occasional research into new current events related to cybersecurity, such as the new ways that cyber-attacks are used in warfare. This club will benefit its members by giving them a likeminded community to learn with, but also to have fun with. We will also explore other niche computer skills, such as hackthebox. We will also have occasional presentations and Q&As from Cybersecurity professionals in order to get insight into the field. 
",,"For now the leadership protocols are pretty simple. We will have a president and co-presidents, each of whom are voted on during the start of every year. This club probably won’t have any other roles, as this is a community, and not just a place to gain titles. So far, the club has only been active in 2021, and the leadership will stay the same, as the current group has voted on it. Members are not expected to have high commitment, as meetings will be in discord to let people be on their computers. Most meetings will be on Wednesdays, depending on the members’ schedules and availability. If a member in a leadership position is inactive for too long, they will lose the position, and a new selection will be voted on by the members. Members may also make a form with a supermajority of votes in order to impeach any leadership member of their role, and then a new vote will be held. Most of this will be on the club discord. Otherwise, this club will be casual, so no pressure on the members. Finally, if any members are doing a cybersecurity competition with the club, they are expected to be more committed, as time is key.
","Cyber security is a field that is constantly evolving, meaning that this club will always have fresh topics to explore. Not only how many people do you have is this club the first club directly centered around cyber security, but with the very nature of cyber security, experimenting is encouraged. We will be experimenting with online cyber security challenges and problems that aren’t found in a normal classroom. Some examples of these are PicoCtf and hackthissite.","Our meeting schedule is not entirely concrete, but we will meet at least three times a month mostly virtual, but occasionally in person.

Social engineering is the process of designing buildings and towns in a way that accounts for how people move around and live their daily lives. The club will explore ways to make New York City more comfortable and sustainable with better technologies such as smart traffic lights and policies such as a carbon tax and improved public transport while discussing how to incentivize businesses and make it easier for people to reduce their carbon footprint. We will also look at existing technologies from around the world and develop technical, policy, and technological solutions to improve the quality of life in New York City and possibly other cities throughout the United States. Some of these ideas will be presented as policy recommendations to city representatives to take the first step in creating change. The policies will be geared to be environmentally friendly, as well as to make life in cities enjoyable and productive.","Socially Engineering Habitats benefits Stuyvesant by helping students develop their problem solving and teamwork skills by researching and creating solutions with the help of other club members. Socially Engineering Habitats also intends to spread awareness about the existence of environmental and technological problems not only in NYC but also the ones around the world. This will be done throughout the club but also via social media, talking to others outside of the club, and possibly demonstrations.

The club does not only intend to only spread awareness about issues, but also drive the change. Together, students will learn how to become involved in their communities and to create real change by talking to their community members and pressuring their leaders and representatives. This will be achieved by drafting policy recommendations using knowledge of physics, environmental science, biology, math, and chemistry for New York City and other cities of interest.

Moreover, the activities at this club will help students to better decide which colleges, careers and fields of study to pursue, such as urban design, engineering and environmental science. 

In the long run, Socially Engineering Habitats will help club members become active and valuable contributors of their communities as well as help society move forward as a whole.

Both presidents should clearly communicate with one another to minimize mutual absences. To remain a President or Co-President, one must have an average (all classes combined) of at least 80%. The secretary is expected to promote the club and its message, note down absences, and give updates on social media.

New leaders will be appointed through leadership applications, which will be held after the current leaders graduate or choose to step down from their positions. Leaders must discuss who they deem are most fit for the leadership positions before appointing new roles and should appoint temporary leaders when school work takes priority. Warnings and removal of a leadership position apply to all positions and will be decided based on a vote by the other current club leaders. If it is decided that additional members are necessary for the club to function well, the board must present a trial leadership application open to all club members. Applicants must fill out an application informing board members of their vision and ideas for the club’s future.

Many Stuyvesant students see people with similar interests but are too shy to speak up to them and make friends, this club will give them the opportunity to talk to other peers and accompany each other in this high school journey. Moreover, after a long day of work many students need a place where they can calm down and relax as well as to reduce the stress upon themselves, and this club is the perfect place for that. Students can express their personalities and thoughts through the use of sandbox games and make creations that tell others more about the student. Furthermore, making creations in sandbox games can also help students in finding imaginations that they once had as a child and boost their creativity which will help a lot in their future careers.

","Stuy Fiction Club hopes to create a very interesting portfolio of fictional projects written by our members. There will be many ways that students can get involved including with writing, editing, and art. Members are expected to attend every meeting, which will not happen too often, but will be very important to the process. Much of the work will be group collaboration off the scenes, with meetings just as often as to discuss any issues and progress that occurs. This is to allow for holding members accountable for their tasks. Every member is expected to meet deadlines, contribute to discussions, and work closely with peers. Leadership positions are available as well, with them being expected to overlook the progress of their department. Founders are expected to work closely with the directors to make sure the process is smooth and efficient. Through this club, students will be able to simulate a writer and their writing environment, as it is a team effort where different people help to make a book. The goal is to create many finished pieces with a specific genre (fiction) with different aspects, allowing students to engage their creativity and take their thoughts to a different level.
","This process will benefit the Stuyvesant community because it will allow students to expand their creativity. When it comes to school, fictional writing is usually left out from the conversation and though Stuyvesant is filled with creative minds, not everyone has the motivation to form a story, as it’s extremely daunting. Stuy Fiction Club hopes to create an environment where everyone is able to work together and in a comfortable, non-judgemental environment, to tell wonderful stories. Besides creativity, this process will also allow readers to grow their interests in writing with multiple opportunities to write and/or edit. The hope is to release some sort of anthology piece with multiple short pieces of writing from members interested (for more individual works). This will allow members to release more of their personal work along with their peers. Anyone is welcome to join and contribute to the process. Everybody will be credited and this will definitely be a memorable experience. This entire club is dedicated to releasing fictional projects that will be created from scratch. That definitely is something to be proud of, and the hope is to have a smooth, fun, and interactive time. Additionally, members will be able to meet new people with this club, possibly with similar interests since this process brings out a lot of interests overall.
",,"There is a small board for this club. The two founders will be in charge of choosing the secretary, who will manage the website. The leading position for this position will be appointed by detailed applications that will be used to gauge what the applicants are able to/hope to contribute to the process. If necessary, smaller positions narrowing in on different tasks needed for the club will be chosen, such as directors. However, this is based on the number of members, the amount of work, and general organization. When the founders graduate, they will select two underclassmen who have shown interest in the club and will pass the baton onto them (based on a form). Before the directors graduate, they will also select different underclassmen to take their places (also based on a form). Strikes will occur based on if a board member / founder isn’t doing their designated tasks, and the rest of the board will vote to see if they deserve one. If 50% or more feel they do, then the specific director/founder will be told the reasoning and be given a warning. If a director or founder receives 3 strikes, they will be removed from their position and it will be given to someone else based on a form.
","What makes this organization unique is that it includes arguably the best aspect of writing that is usually overlooked: fiction. In school, students are usually taught to write essays, poems, research papers, reports, etc. Students usually are unable to explore their interests in fiction so this organization hopes to create an environment where students are able to grow their interests in fiction, but more specifically creating fiction in multiple ways such as writing, editing, and the actual storytelling.
","As an organization, Stuy Fiction Club hopes to meet a minimum of two times a month for about an hour in person or remotely, but we may increase the amount of meetings based on certain assignments that need to be done and member availability.

","Chill Pill strives to cultivate an inclusive, non-judgemental zone for students, regardless of gender, grade, or interests, to share experiences and feelings with other peers, all while discussing and shedding light on the importance of mental health and its implications. This community aims to provide young individuals with a safe space to simply be themselves, outside of their roles as students, athletes, or other identities. While ChillPill fosters one’s individuality by strengthening one’s connection with their own life experiences and emotions, our open-discussion support groups serve to tackle issues students face in a group setting, where members are seen simply as those who relate to and can help one another. Students can seek help, friendships, or simply a platform to vent whilst learning and improving from peers sharing similar experiences. ChillPill also has an anonymity aspect where support groups may be audio-only or with cameras off, as opening up can be extremely nerve-wracking, and removing that wall takes time. 

Especially as mental health is such an important topic in the education system, Chill Pill aims not just to be a space for students to recognize and improve their own mindsets with the help of other students, but also a learning environment where students can expand their knowledge on mental health and mental illness. Chill Pill strives to shed more awareness on mental health as a whole, educating bright, young students on what mental health, an umbrella term ranging from mental illness to everyday emotions, encompasses. Chill Pill addresses stigmatized and taboo topics of individuals and society as a whole, aiming to broaden members’ horizons as they share their own struggles and stories with one another. Through open-discussion support meetings tackling topics like seeking academic validation and struggling with disorganization/procrastination, guest speaker events with professional therapists, mental health advocates, and social media creators, and self-care and wellness events as a hands-on experience cultivating friendships and relationships after a long day at school. Chill Pill continues its mission at the Stuyvesant High School branch as their saying goes: “Come One, Come All”. 
","Chill Pill personally addresses issues of mental health directly back to the Stuyvesant community itself, as topics of discussion meetings are tailored to what students currently are struggling with or want to learn more about for the future. Especially at a school as academically rigorous and driven as Stuyvesant, Chill Pill is a space for students to cry, laugh, comfort, and most importantly, listen, help, and learn from one another. Through our club, we hope to foster a sense of community by allowing students to be their most authentic selves as they share their own experiences and learn more about the topic of mental health that looms over them daily. As many students often feel uncomfortable sharing the obstacles they face and struggle with mental health, ChillPill strives to encourage vulnerability in forming genuine connections. 

Because the Chill Pill community discusses various societal issues like body image and familial relationships as well as individual feelings and struggles like planning ahead, feeling lonely, and having test anxiety, this club ensures that a wide variety of topics are accounted for. Chill Pill allows everyone’s voices to be heard as we take students on a learning journey of discovering and taking of their own mental health, as well as becoming more aware of those around them as they lend support to others. Such discussions and lessons strengthen students’ mindsets and wellbeings as they continue in both their personal and academic lives at Stuyvesant and beyond. Chill Pill nurtures students’ mental health so they can freely pursue their hopes and dreams knowing this community exists to always support and listen to them. It is only when one’s mental health is addressed and supported that their journey at Stuyvesant is maximized to its greatest potential. 
",https://www.instagram.com/stuychillpill/ ,"Chillpill’s leadership positions compose of a president, vice president, social media manager, secretary, and events coordinator(s), which make up the board. As of right now, the founders will be the president and vice president, but applications will be sent out in the beginning of the semester for those interested in the other 3 positions, and interviews may follow. Leadership positions are given to people who can demonstrate dedication and commitment to the club. Anyone can apply but priority will be given to those who demonstrate interest, effort, and leadership skills. For specific protocols, pronouns must be respected and everyone must be respectful and welcoming to one another; especially when personal experiences are being shared in discussions, it is mandatory that everyone acts appropriately. If there is an instance where a member feels uncomfortable, they can speak to any of the board members and we will take action accordingly. Right now, the founders are the president and vice president. Presidents and vice presidents hold their position until they graduate or until they are impeached. However, the rest of the leaders can change every year as there will be applications for a social media manager, secretary, and event coordinator(s) every 2 semesters; current position holders can reapply. Leaders who receive three strikes will be impeached. Some acts that warrant a strike include but are not limited to rudeness, racism, discrimination, sexism, inactivity, unexcused absences, etc. When founders graduate or are impeached, in the months prior, applications will be sent out to select the president and vice president-in-training. Selected candidates will move on to interviews and then the final round, where members of ChillPill personally vote for the individuals; these votes are taken into account when the current presidents make their decision. 
","ChillPill is one of the only clubs that focus on students’ individual mental health while simultaneously broadening their knowledge surrounding mental health and its effects and application. This community is open to everyone, not just those suffering from mental health issues, as everyone has feelings and obstacles they wish to share and overcome. We aim to educate about mental health while also supporting those either struggling with mental health or just looking for a judgment-free community to share their feelings and experiences with like-minded individuals. Unlike other clubs focusing on a specific hobby or passion that members enjoy, Chill Pill strives to be a club that comforts its members so they can pursue what they love and thrive whilst at Stuyvesant. In addition to regular meetings, either virtual or in-person, ChillPill also has other applications for those who may not be able to make it, or who want to be in ChillPill casually; ChillPill offers an app that helps you find new friends in an anonymous audio-only support group where everyone is welcome, worthy, and valid in discussing their mental health, as well as wellness and bonding events to find other like-minded individuals and be of support to one another, all while learning more about mental health, one of the most pressing topics in our society today. 

","Chill Pill aims to meet 3 times a month, but it is flexible depending on members’ availability. For now, these meetings will be held both in person or virtually through zoom, and the type will be decided based on availability as well. In-person meetings are aimed to be held at 3:50 pm and virtual meetings at later in the day, like 6 pm, to ensure our members can get home without any feelings of being rushed.

Members who are interested will be required to fill out a written application with three to five questions regarding motives for applying, qualifications and ideas for the club. In addition to the written application, applicants may be invited to a short, informal interview. Leaders of the club for a given school year will be announced in June of the prior school year.

Stuyvesant Latin Club,StuyLatin,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/StuyLatin/da0a37c7,The Stuyvesant Latin Club is dedicated to creating a welcoming environment for the people at Stuy passionate about studying and competing in classics.,"The purpose of the Stuyvesant Latin Club is to serve as a place for discussion of the classics. ""The classics"" is a term that refers to Greek and Roman culture, from mythology to day to day life. As well as discussing classics, the club would also serve as a place for discussion and studying of Latin. More specifically, the Latin Club would facilitate studying for upcoming classics and Latin exams, as it is presumed that there would be large overlap between Latin students and those interested in being a part of the classics club. Of course it should be noted that when studying would be involved it would not be the sole focus of sessions so as to not exclude those who would have no need for the study sessions. While there is some classics education in the Latin classes, the Stuy Latin Club would strive to go far beyond what is already taught. ","The Stuyvesant Latin Club will benefit the Stuyvesant Community by continuing its legacy of being an academic safe space for students of the humanities, specifically the branch of humanities that is classics, in a predominantly STEM oriented school. We allow students to pursue their interests of classics and mythology, and we also create a place for academic mentorship - if a student needs help with work from their Latin class, they can always come to a Stuyvesant Latin Club meeting for it. Building off of the mentorship perspective, we also help students prepare for extracurricular classics exams, including but not limited to the National Latin Exam, the Medusa Mythology Exam, and the Nation Roman Civilization Exam. We are also working on creating an intramural Certamen team. Certamen is effectively a classics competition, and we want to help Stuyvesant compete in it. The club is also not entirely academically aligned - for example, in preparing for the Medusa Mythology Exam we will review myths. Anybody can contribute a myth, or simply listen to one being told. Overall, the club benefits the Stuyvesant community by bolstering its burgeoning classics program and community, both within Stuyvesant itself and in the classics field city and nation-wide.",,"The leadership positions are president, vice-president, and director, although this is of course subject to change as the year goes on. The only specific protocols that members should adhere to are the following: being interested in classics and mythology, demonstrating engagement when people present (members and leaders will present myths, although this is not a mandatory exercise), and attempting to show up to as many sessions as possible. The policy for transfer of leadership is going to be through the leaders' discussion and selection. There will not be a vote. Members demonstrating noticeable interest, participation, and attendance may be elected to leadership positions simply by virtue of their demonstrated involvement, though this would likely happen only if a leader is not living up to their role and people feel that they need to be replaced. However applications for unoccupied positions will be held via google form that will be emailed to all interested students and the current board will decide upon who receives that leadership position. ","The Stuyvesant Latin Club is unique because it is the only club dedicated to the classics at Stuyvesant. The humanities is already a niche subject at Stuy, and classics especially. Stuyvesant Latin Club seeks to counter that by working as an academic mentorship and cultural appreciation group at Stuy. It is also possibly the only club dedicated to competition within a language, as well as history, art, language, mythology, and extraneous other things in relation to classics (including, for example, appreciation of popular songs sung in Latin).

Stuyvesant Climbing Club,stuyclimbs,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyclimbs/0e90b770,This club will provide students with an opportunity to engage in climbing related activities and develop strong outdoor skills in safe learning env.,"The Stuyvesant Climbing Club will provide students interested in climbing with opportunities to learn and strengthen skills such as advanced climbing technique, rope and safety procedures, and trip planning. The club will serve to prepare students for outdoor climbing adventures both in the city and in New England. Participants will be able to develop specific skills such as belaying and rappelling, self-rescue and outdoor safety methods, navigation, trail conservation, and climbing photography. Likewise, Leave No Trace and similar environmental principles will be taught and enforced. We will introduce members to all that climbing has to offer with an emphasis on six main disciplines: gym climbing, bouldering, sport climbing, trad climbing, ice and alpine climbing, and big wall climbing. Safety and efficiency will be emphasized in everything we do. Overall, participants of all experience and comfort levels will benefit from joining this club as they will be exposed to new experiences and will be given the opportunity to teach and learn from other other members who share the same passion for climbing. All members are expected to attend most events and positively contribute to the club. Ultimately, our goal is to inspire climbers to go outside and challenge themselves.","Currently, Stuyvesant does not have a club dedicated to climbing. Furthermore, Stuyvesant has very few outdoor-focused clubs, so our climbing club will fill that void. This club will provide students who are interested in climbing with the ability to meet and discuss with others who share the same passion for climbing in a positive and safe environment. Additionally, we hope to introduce climbing to students with no prior experience. Many people, especially in New York exclusively climb in indoor climbing gyms, so we aim to inspire members to get outside and challenge themselves on real rock. We will provide all instruction necessary for our members to achieve their outdoor goals. Climbing can also serve as a great way to reduce stress and have fun while exposing oneself to new and different environments. Climbing as a sport is a great workout. It is a full body activity, and it builds cardiovascular endurance as well as muscle strength. The mental aspect is also relevant; climbing is even more difficult mentally than it is physically. One must overcome many mental hurdles on their way up a route, including determining the proper technique known as “beta,” as well as navigated the gripping fear that is associated with leading committing routes in severe conditions. We aim to meet on a regular basis to discuss various climbing techniques, with an emphasis on safety. Ultimately, this club will bring one of New York City’s first student run outdoor programs to Stuyvesant.","@kostadubovskiy and @olivermilstein on Instagram, Kosta Dubovskiy and Oliver Milstein on Facebook","Leadership will consist of the founding members for the first year. The founders will serve as co-presidents and delegate all work needed to help the organization thrive. Leadership for the next year will be chosen at the end of each school year. Club presidents will be appointed by the current leaders and ratified by club members. Should more than three-quarters of club members disagree with the appointment, new leaders will be chosen. Sufficient training will be given to leaders to ensure the longevity of this organization. It is important to note, however, that leadership is not the priority of this organization, and thus will not be emphasized. All members are expected to contribute to the club in a meaningful way regardless of leadership positions. Impeachment is a highly unlikely situation, but in the event that club leadership is contradictory to the organization’s mission, a 3/4 majority of club members will be able to select new presidents. Members can join the club at any point during the year, and we have no formal application process. We encourage people to join in the fall, however, so they can fully benefit from the instructional lessons given during the first part of the year. ","Stuyvesant doesn't currently have any organizations devoted to outdoor activities. This club would enable students to try something new in a supportive, safe environment meant to promote learning. Though other environmentally related clubs exist, none of them are dedicated to sports in the outdoors. Climbing is an obscure sport to some extent and shrouded in mystery. Onlookers always ask “What happens if you fall?” We hope to demonstrate that, when done properly, climbing is a safe activity. Our club aims to lift this veil and give Stuyvesant students the opportunity to learn more about climbing in a low-pressure environment.","Our schedule will vary, but we plan to meet around once a week and possibly more in winter/fall.","['tuesday', 'thursday']",medium,"['climbing', 'sports', 'climb']",,"Konstantin Dubovskiy - Tiger Admiral General

At Stuy, there are many clubs that are made to challenge student's physical and academic prowess, and add even more rigor to their day. Film Club is a place for students to relax after facing Stuyvesant's stressful and competitive atmosphere. There are very few clubs or organizations at Stuyvesant whose purpose is not to promote further competition and challenges, but rather to alleviate the everyday stresses that come with being a Stuyvesant student.

Members of this club investigate how and why proteins fold into their specific structures. Each year, club members will go through a research and voting process to decide which protein(s) we want to focus on; then, members will collaborate to find important aspects of our protein of choice to learn about, including group readings of current scientific literature. We will create a model based on this specific aspect and print it using Stuy's 3-D printers at the Innovation Lab. At the end of the research and design process, members will work together and create a poster to convey the story of the protein and its model. Finally, we will attend the annual citywide MAPS (Modeling a Protein Story) conference, where we will display our work and learn about projects from other schools. 

As a side project for returning members, we will be working together to create models demonstrating interactions of proteins related to the biology curriculum. Modeling and 3-D printing provide invaluable resources for obtaining a deeper understanding of biological structures. With our skill set, we will also make guides and small explainers for topics that go beyond the curriculum; for example, we could explore how kinesin (the walking protein) works!","Members of Stuy Proteomics will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge from biology to a real research project. Members will also be able to explore biology as a career option. Unlike other biology research clubs, the team aspect of this project fosters collaboration, not just among members, but also between schools. Members will learn to have an open mind about the process of research and design and will learn about other schools' projects and molecules of interest. We stray away from the traditional memorization that many students dislike about biology. Instead, we use hands-on approaches and collaboration to investigate real-life applications of biological research. Participating in Stuy Proteomics will give members a more in-depth understanding of what the work of scientists consists of on a day-to-day basis and how they collaborate and share results. In addition, we have permission to utilize Stuy’s 3-D printers to print models of proteins that can be used in future biology classrooms at Stuy. How many times have you wished that there was a model for you to understand a concept in biology better? With models created in our club, we can expand our individual passions for biology, as well as contribute to future biology classes.",,"Despite there being leadership positions in Stuy Proteomics, all members are encouraged to participate equally in the project. Before every meeting, members are expected to complete the work assigned during the previous meeting and follow all deadlines assigned. As we approach the symposium, members are expected to attend more meetings and dedicate more time to the project. 

Leadership positions will be available to everyone who shows a genuine dedication to helping the club. Members can indicate interest in a leadership position through Google Forms that are sent out periodically, and current leaders will consult with the faculty advisor for appointments. Leadership positions transfer between school years; however, if someone with a leadership position fails to contribute actively to the club, their position may be given to another member. If any of the members have issues with another member, the leaders will work together with the faculty advisor to come up with a suitable resolution.","Unlike other STEM clubs, Stuy Proteomics is adaptive to each member’s interests and provides the opportunity to explore current research beyond a textbook. Though we always go through the basics of protein modeling and reading scientific literature, there is no set curriculum and the course the club takes is unique each year. For example, in the 2021-22 school year, the club originally sought to explore proteins related to SARS-CoV-2, and as the pandemic continued, our project turned towards antibodies and variants. Additionally, the annual citywide symposium we participate in allows members to improve their public speaking and scientific communication skills; it provides a genuine outlet to share our work with like-minded students and collaborate with other schools.

Climate science helps us understand what the one percent are doing to our environment right now through climate change, and how it will change. Meteorology protects human lives by allowing us to predict where devastating storms will be, and where to evacuate. Discussing these topics with their peers could help them improve their communication skills. Members will also have the opportunity to hear from guest speakers. This could enable them to learn about these fields, a potential career path, and/or current research. The club will also work on projects relating to astronomy and climate. The topics will be chosen collectively by the club. These projects could include programming, because both astronomy and climate involve large amounts of data. Students will have the opportunity to work on these projects, which could benefit the scientific world. This club may also begin giving weather forecasts to the student body, and/or raise funding to set up an amateur weather station at Stuyvesant. This will give students detailed advance notice on weather events across the city, which will help them prepare for or plan future activities. Members of the club may get the chance to see stars and planets in greater detail through telescopes, which is normally difficult due to New York City’s notoriously polluted skies.

Impeachment will be considered if any of the previous statements (beginning with “Hateful behavior…” and ending with “case-by-case basis”) become applicable, or if there are other repeated complaints regarding someone in a leadership position. The impeachment process is as follows: All members are welcome to submit complaints regarding any student leader to any other student leader. The subject of the complaint will be addressed. If the issue persists, or a large quantity of complaints are filed against a student leader, the position of the student leader will be reevaluated. All other student leaders will vote whether to remove the student leader in question. The student leader in question may not vote. If a student leader is removed from their position, they may choose to remain a member of the club.

Stuy Birdies,stuybirdies,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuybirdies/e930130c,Stuy birdies aims to provide a judgement-free zone where badminton players of all skill levels play with other Stuyvesant students/alum,"Stuy Birdies is a club for those that are interested in badminton and want to play it with other Stuyvesant Students. It operates by hosting meetings on long weekends and over breaks. The meeting day gets announced and anyone who wants to come to a meeting will let it be know in the discord. Stuy Birdies picks a badminton center, usually Tiger Badminton in Queens, and then lets anyone show up to play. Since it is a low-commitment club, not much is required from the members. It is asked that you join the Stuy Birdies Discord in order to streamline communication and make life easier. There are also no dues and the only money you would have to pay is when you go to a badminton center to play with your peers. Aside from that, everything is completely free. In this way, Stuy Birdies is allowing stuy students to find other badminton enthusiasts, to create friends, find common ground, and have a fun experience with those that share similar interests","Stuy Birdies is the only club at stuyvesant where young badminton enthusiasts can gather at one place to enjoy an uncommon sport. While growing in popularity in America, badminton isn't very well known by most people. Badminton is most popular in Asian countries, being China's number one sport. As stuyvesant's student body is 74 percent Asian-American, we aim to provide a place for like-minded players can come together and play with other friends and previously stuyvesant alum. Not only do students benefit from the great sparring opportunity as new players are constantly joining, but it's also a great time to learn from players better and more experienced than you. Many of Stuy Birdies' members were previously on the Boys Badminton Team, who made finals 2 years in a row. These players have great on-court experience and are willing to play with any new players that join Stuy Birdies. New members can get access to courts with good lighting, mats, and feather birds: a rare luxury in most commercial gyms at community centers. All of these new experiences can allow badminton enthusiasts to increase their skill, build their confidence, and give opportunities for students to interact with other players. Stuy Birdies will help enrich the stuvesant badminton circle and diversify the player base with students across all skill levels. ","https://discord.gg/gnS5ZvpG, Lukas Chang(lchang30@stuy.edu), Giridhar Bonu(gbonu30@stuy.edu)","Leadership positions are handed down based on the previous leader. We lean towards upperclassmen for these positions however, as they usually have more manager and/or playing experience. As a low commitment club, members are not required to attend every meeting, and inactive members would not be punished. If you want to stay and play, that's great. If not, you're free to leave the discord/club. It takes a lot of effort to manage such an event, as different clubs cost different per hour, per player, and everyone lives a different distance from a given club. Therefore, we will often need managers to organize and take polls on members to find the optimal time, location, and cost for each player. These managers have a high likelihood of being appointed as the next leader, since management skills correspond with the duties as a leader for Stuy Birdies. Therefore, a certain amount of commitment is required before you're considered as the next leader once the previous ones graduate. ","Stuy Birdies is currently the only club at stuyvesant that provides consistent meetings and recognition for badminton as well as providing a place for students to play the sport. Stuy Birdies consistently manages groups of up to 20 people to go to one club in NYC and play for 2-3 hours. Without Stuy Birdies, it will be difficult to manage a group play for badminton, payment, and scheduling appointments with different clubs across the city. It also provides a unique experience for badminton players at stuyvesant to interact with different badminton materials, players, and courts.

Students are placed in a cohort, consisting of 7-10 Stuyvesant alum. Each student is paired with an alum, who will act as a mentor to the student. Students attend five cohort sessions (led by a mentor leader and a student leader) and multiple public workshops throughout the school year. The program exposes students to many skills that cannot be obtained from classes alone, such as life skills, college essay writing, public speaking, resume writing, interview preparation, and understanding the college application. An industry panel is held at the end of the program, consisting of careers in finance, medicine, law, engineering, computer science, entrepreneurship, and many others. Students will be given the chance to learn about different careers in the field(s) they are interested in. They will gain diverse perspectives from the mentors, ranging from experiences in high school to college to careers. Students are expected to show up to all cohort sessions and workshops.","Stuyvesant High School is filled with brilliant students who are excited to take courses that align with their interests. However, most of these students do not have much exposure to skills that are essential after high school. The Stuyvesant Alumni Mentoring Program will prepare students beyond just taking rigorous courses and will create bright students who take initiative and know how to excel in life. The Stuyvesant Alumni Mentoring Program will transform students into being more knowledgeable about many things: the college application process (alumni often share their experiences and assist their mentees with this), college essay writing (alumni will give students feedback on their writing), public speaking (students will present in front of an audience to improve this skill), resume writing (students will learn how to market themselves), interviewing skills (many alumni have a lot of experience with interviewing students from top colleges, so they provide a valuable source of information on how to be a good interviewee), and different careers that one may pursue (there are alumni in every field, STEM arts, and humanities, and it is easy to connect with them). By offering important information and insight, the Stuyvesant Alumni Mentoring Program will ultimately create students who have strengths both academically and socially.",Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stuymentoring/ Discord: https://discord.gg/GMgYx7qHD2,"The Stuyvesant Alumni Mentoring Program has two types of leadership positions: Senior Student Leaders and Student Leaders. Both the Senior Student Leaders and Student Leader are chosen by the program directors and founders (past Stuyvesant alum). Multiple Student Leaders are selected each year. Student Leaders must recruit mentees for the program. They also manage a cohort alongside their Mentor Leader (an alum) by taking attendance, keeping track of mentee assignment completion, facilitating cohort sessions, sending emails to mentees and mentors, and regularly communicating with their Mentor Leader. A student must apply and go through an interview process in order to become a Student Leader. A Senior Student Leader must be a former mentee who was a Student Leader in the previous year. The Senior Student Leaders works alongside the program director and acts as a guide to the Student Leaders by reminding them to complete certain tasks. Students holding leadership positions must have excellent attendance, complete cohort assignments, and display dedication to the program. Impeachment protocols follow a 3-strike system: if leaders fail to show up at a meeting without notice, do not keep track of assignments or complete tasks, or fail to communicate with their mentor leader, it will count as a strike. After 3 strikes, impeachment protocols will be activated and be brought to the program directors. 
","The Stuyvesant Alumni Mentoring Program allows students to hear about the experiences of Stuyvesant alumni from high school (relating to the college process) to network with alumni. As aforementioned, they will develop soft skills that are often not taught in schools. These are the skills that will be important later in life, allowing students to be leaders who know how to effectively communicate with others. The program consists of many workshops where students can work side by side with alumni. For instance, students prepare a college essay draft, which will then be reviewed by the alumni. The program provides each student with many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone and receive useful tips from their mentors.","Different cohorts meet on different days of the week, and workshops take place on Saturdays.

Plane Crash Documentary Club,pcdc,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/pcdc/bb250e63,To create a space for students to learn from historical events regarding plane crashes.,"The Plane Crash Documentary Club serves to educate students on infamous events regarding plane crashes, giving them a better understanding of the errors, physical and mechanical, that led to individual events. Through the use of documentaries students can go deeper into behind the scenes of such events, learning of prior actions that set up each error, whether it be human error, human intervention, or a faulty vehicle. This club also serves as a space for students to learn from each other in discussion on such events and explore the possible solutions to become smarter members of society in the process. In addition, this club serves as a social space for students to take their mind off school material and reflect on another topic in plane crashes. We hope to maintain an educational environment where students can learn together about some of the most overlooked tragedies of human history, reflecting on them to better their own personal and professional lives.

","Despite all educational opportunities provided by the prestigious Stuyvesant High School, there’s always more to know, and our club is simply doing its part in providing more learning experiences for interested students. Also, as opposed to stressful classes whose educational benefits quite infamously come at the cost of the student's mental health, our class provides a healthy community that prioritizes education through interaction, which by effect doesn’t create any stress having to struggle by yourself as you attempt to solve some problem you think you know the answer to but can’t be sure. On the contrary, the low commitment of the club makes it borderline impossible to carry any stress over to the lives of students, our club serves as an infrequent escape from the stressful school environment to bond with friends while learning about a shared interest. The low commitment educational experience our club provides is a perfect balance for what a club should be. It’s not too much to become a burden that students dread looking towards, and instead it becomes an escape that students can look towards every month to watch something completely different than anything they experience at Stuyvesant, which I personally think encapsulates the one word I would use to describe this club: refreshing.",https://discord.gg/sbENevfgKs,"Leadership positions include the President(s), Outreach Director, and Flight Attendants. The Presidents' role is to schedule and lead meeting and may involve themselves in the responsibilities of alternate positions. The Outreach Directors are tasked with advertising the club, which may include managing social media accounts and putting up posters around the school. The Flight Attendants are tasked with helping the President to lead meetings, whether it be controlling discussion or managing the documentaries being played. The Flight Attendants and Outreach Directors are appointed by the President(s), and Presidents are chosen by previous/current Presidents, with the exception of the original holder of the role. No additional protocols are expected of members. In the case of transferring leadership, the President of one-year choses the President for the next year, who then choses their own board of Outreach Directors and Flight Attendants. If for some reason a President cannot chose their successor, the Outreach Director may choose the next President. In case of the Outreach Director not being able to choose, the responsibility goes down to Flight Attendants. In the case no positions of leadership can choose, all remaining members will hold a vote through a google form to choose. Should an Outreach Director or Flight Attendant fail to meet their responsibilities, Presidents have to power to impeach and replace these members, but should the President abuse this power or fail to meet their own expectations, any member can choose to initiate a member only vote, which forces the President to step down from their position should a majority vote for that decision be reached, in which case a second vote will follow to elect a new President.","The Plane Crash Documentary Club focuses on something no other club focus’ on, plane crash documentaries, and the information gathered in this club is vastly different than any other club. Along with this, this club is vastly different from any history class despite seeming so similar. Most events covered in this club don't reach conversation during history class.

Each meeting will be announced on our Instagram account and in our Facebook group by Sunday night, and members will inform a club leader whether they plan on attending that meeting or not so the leaders can gauge interest. Club leaders will make choreography in rotation and teach members their choreography during choreo workshops. Videos of the choreos will be posted after the meetings on Instagram and Facebook for members who were not able to attend or want to refer back to it. Videos of members performing the choreo at the end of the meeting will also be made available to those who would like to use them to improve later on. Conditioning sessions, consisting of core workouts, stretching, and more, will help members build technique and muscle strengths that will be necessary for the choreo learned on workshop days.","StuyModern will provide an outlet for students who want to let loose after a long school day and participate in an expressive, physical activity in a safe and supportive environment. After sitting at desks all day in class, members can creatively move to music and meet other people who enjoy similar interests including dance and music. This would serve as a way to get exercise through a form of art as many people do not enjoy traditional exercises. This would also help students gain confidence with their body awareness and self expression through the skills we build. Members would learn to use different types of arm movements and facial expressions to connect to their audience while keeping a strong and precise lower body. Modern dance also helps improve posture, which illuminates long term benefits for Stuy students who tend to slouch while studying. Many people believe that dance is not as physically strenuous as other forms of exercise including sports, but dance actually requires many years of training to gain control over and achieve full motion in your body. StuyModern welcomes students of all grades to create a diverse community of both underclassmen and upperclassmen who can work together and help each other out.",,"Leadership positions would be appointed by current leaders via an application process. Leaders must have an adequate amount of both dance experience and dance knowledge. For the application, they are required to answer short response questions and submit a dance video of their own choreo. Current leaders would then evaluate everyone’s application, and choose who we believe are the best candidates for the leadership position(s). Choreographers are required to submit a video of their own choreo, but as for our other positions, it may vary, depending on what the position is (some dance experience is still required for every position - for example, positions include choreographers, leaders in training, social media manager, and etc.) Lastly, the transfer of leadership would occur at the end of every year if needed (for example, if a leader leaves or graduates). However, if we have leaders in training (for underclassmen), then they will automatically become the next leaders for the upcoming year.","StuyModern aims to create a positive and supportive environment for students to take their first steps into the world of modern dance or hone their existing techniques. Regardless of experience level, members can learn choreography from leaders who would like to practice their craft and express themselves by creating choreography and teaching. Not only can members learn steps to a dance, but members can also learn to express themselves comfortably using staples of modern dance. Many dance groups at Stuy only teach choreo and do not take the time to teach technique, so we aim to build these fundamentals alongside creativity by alternating between choreo workshops and technique building sessions.","We will hold one meeting per week, on a varying day each week depending on availability.

Members who decide to DM will be expected to do the required prep work, whether it be writing up their own campaigns or deciding which pre-made module to use. They will also be in charge of making sure their members are up to date. This will help to imbue into them useful leadership and organizational skills.

The improvisational aspects of the game, in addition to the unique characters each member will be creating for themselves, will help members develop their creative writing and acting skills, will help teach team building, and will strengthen the friendships forged in this club.

Stuy Soccer,stuysoccer,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuysoccer/144b2839,Stuy Soccer hopes to provide a home to all of the soccer fans in Stuyvesant.,"Soccer is one of the most popular sports in Stuyvesant. Stuy soccer is the place for all fans to come together and create a strong community around “the beautiful game.” This club will host meetings several times a month. Meetings will involve group activities such as watching a game together, talking about recent developments, and even playing some pick-up soccer at a park. We do try to respect covid safety protocols so if there is a sharp outbreak of covid cases, we try to push off meetings until it is safer to hold a gathering. Most meetings will be on Friday, but that is subject to change depending on the availability of club members.
	Absolutely no experience is required to join. Everyone is welcome to come to Stuy Soccer meetings. No meeting will be mandatory, but members are expected to come to a handful of gatherings each semester to remain active. If members show passion and dedication to the club, they will be rewarded with leadership opportunities in the future. 
","Stuyvesant lacks a home for soccer fans. Even though it is one of the most popular sports in the school, the only place where people passionate about soccer get to meet up are the school soccer teams. Unfortunately, Stuy does not have a junior varsity program and that limits many Stuyvesant soccer enthusiasts from having a place where they can make new friends based on their passion for the sport. Given that joining the soccer team is a major commitment that not everyone can afford, Stuy Soccer hopes to create a more inclusive, laid-back environment for everyone. Moreover, Stuy Soccer hopes to have meetings where players on the soccer team can train in the offseason in order make sure that their skills stay sharp all year round. Students aspiring to join the team in the future can also use the club as a place to get better.
Stuy Soccer’s ultimate goal is to help people across Stuyvesant create stronger bonds with each other. One of the many effects of the pandemic is that it made it much harder to socialize and find new friends. The community that Stuy Soccer will create will help combat this effect and create a club where many members will be able to make lifelong relationships.
",,"President – The president is the public face of the club. They are the head of marketing and they are the head of recruitment. Strong communication skills are needed for this position. Good time management is also required because this position is a major commitment. Soccer ability may be a role that helps bolster one’s case to become president, but it will not be required.

Vice-President – The vice-president will also play an important role in marketing and recruitment, but the main role of the vice president is to handle most of the administrative business (e.g. the scheduling of meetings, updating Stuy Activites). Skill will not be considered for this position, but the vice president should know a lot about soccer. The vice president is also expected to come up with meeting ideas and should show clear dedication to the club.

Mentor – This position will be rewarded to anyone who displays exceptional skill during our pick-up soccer games. A mentor will be expected to help train less experienced members. There is no limit on the number of mentors, but a reasonable ratio between mentors to active members must be maintained.

Leaders for the next year will be selected at the end of each year by the President, Vice President, and the mentors. They will be rewarded based on commitment and priority will be given to existing board members.

If the board wants to remove a leader, there must be a ⅘ majority among the board.

Stuy Soccer is a place where all soccer fans can gather. Currently, the only places for soccer fans at Stuy are the soccer teams. However, not everyone has enough time to join these teams and therefore there is a need for a club where fans can gather in a more laid-back and low-commitment environment. Moreover, there is no existing organization within Stuyvesant where soccer fans can watch games together or talk about recent developments. Stuy Soccer will fill in that void. 
",Our meeting schedule varies but Stuy Soccer will usually meet around twice a month and sometimes even more. No meeting is mandatory but members are expected to attend at least a handful of meetings each semester. ,['friday'],low,"['soccer', 'sports', 'athletics']",,"Nakib Abedin - Vice-President

Stuyvesant Machine Learning Club,ml4stuy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/ml4stuy/1fb2aef1,The Stuyvesant Machine Learning Club's mission is to teach and discuss the principles of machine learning in a practical and accessible manner.,"The club will focus on introducing Stuyvesant students to the rapidly expanding field of machine learning. After introducing basic ideas of the field, we will rapidly transition to focusing on exciting new discoveries and applications, participate in competitions on sites such as Kaggle, and collaborate on personal projects. Overall, the club will serve as an environment for people to grow and learn together, with the average meeting consisting primarily of discussion on fascinating developments in the field, in both applications and techniques, sharing progress made in projects and competitions, and working collaboratively to solve problems club members are having. We aim to augment machine learning understanding for students of all skill levels, whether that be no knowledge of code or projects already completed. To achieve this, we will use technology including Google Colab and FastAI, as well as collaboration and discussion amongst club members, that combine to allow even beginners to create and experiment on incredibly impressive projects.","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant Community by introducing the field of machine learning to stuyvesant students, a field which is rapidly becoming crucial in every facet of our lives. The club will strive to do this in three main ways. Firstly, the club will select prominent and/or exciting devlopments at the pinnacle of machine learning, from Midjourney to Mitsuku and many more, for students to discuss, learn from, and even build with. Secondly, the club will allow students a space to discuss and collaborate on their personal ML projects on any and all of the endless disciplines ML can aid, to simultaneously enhance the projects and ideas of students. Finally, the club will teach the processes of a ML project through doing, creating deep comprehension of data collection, augmentation, and optimization, tools essential to not only ML projects but a range of other data science applications, all continually growing in importance. These three combine to benefit Stuyvesant by providing a place for students to learn skills and concepts that are critical across a host of currently relevant fields, new ideas of the scope of programming, and a place where students, regardless of skill level, are able to share ideas, projects, and plans, and thus learn from a host of new perspectives. ",,"Currently, the leadership positions are two co-presidents. When the co-presidents choose to step down from their role, or graduate, new leaders will be chosen by election amongst the group. The club co-presidents, before leaving, will ensure the new leaders have the necesary knoweldge to teach and lead oncoming years of club members. This will ensure the club can continue to serve members of all skill levels in growing their skills and repetoire.
A vote to impeach can be implemented by consensus of two thirds of the club, and will lead to a new election in which all club members with at least four monthes experience can choose to run in.

If the two co-presidents believe that a new leadership role, below them(e.g. beginner instructor or competition head) would be best for the club, they can create the role, but must leave the filling of the vote to a club election. 

If members find a particular invention or devleopment pertient to machine learning fascinating, and believe they warrant a longer discussion, the member(s) can email the club leaders to have a meeting focused on the discussion of said invention/devleopment.

Members responsibility is simply to be kind, respectful towards each other and the co-presidents, and be willing to collaborate, to allow for the fastest, broadest learning for all in the club.

Leaders of the club are expected to respond to inquiry in a timely manner, organize and plan meetings, and help members to the best of their abilty, whether that be through direct answering or guiding.","Our organization is unique as we allow for new perspectives on programming by creating a space where students can rapidly grow their comprehension of machine learning, starting from all skill levels. This allows students to gain increasingly valuable skills, learn and experience first-hand the resolution and process of programming problems, and solidify their ideas and plans through discussion and explanations. Overall, these features create a space in which club members will rapidly broaden their skills, ideas, and overall conception of programming.","Our meeting schedule will vary as the year progresses, but we will meet one or two times a month, with another possible meeting or two for certain Kaggle competitions, depending on the desires of club members.",['wednesday'],low,"['ai', 'ml', 'machine']",,"Daniel Elliott - Creator

Stuy Aprendamos,stuyaprendamos,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyaprendamos/6b9b3390,"To encourage students, despite their level of background experience, to immerse in the Spanish language and Hispanic culture outside of the classroom.","Stuy Aprendamos aims to introduce Spanish to those with little prior experience with the language, such as incoming freshmen with trouble adjusting to learning a new language, as the name suggests (Aprendamos = Let's Learn). The club also welcomes those seasoned with the language and hope to help foster a community that embraces the language and culture. Stuy Aprendamos aims to provide its members with access to beneficial learning tools such as FluentU in order that are not generally provided within the classroom in order to nourish the learning process with unique approaches. In addition to resources, Stuy Aprendamos expects general members to attend meetings as frequently as possible (not necessary to attend all to retain membership). Meetings will vary from informational to recreational. Informational meetings will aim to clear confusion amongst members about the happenings of their curriculum through additional lessons and Q&A sessions. Informational meetings will also serve to introduce members to Hispanic culture through historical lessons and media, such as movies and telenovelas. Recreational meetings serve as a more 'fun' aspect for members to enjoy. These meetings will vary in terms of creativity but serve as an immersive, appreciative experience for members. Examples of these includes Game Night, including Loteria and El Repollo, and possibly a Potluck.","Stuyvesant High School offers over a hundred clubs, pubs, and activities and around 10 of them are cultural clubs. Amongst these lacks a club that is dedicated to encouraging language & cultural immersion in the Hispanic world. Such a lack is concerning given that Spanish is one of the most popular language courses offered at this school. Despite high achievements, many students express concern with the course depending on how it is taught to them. They find it uninteresting or difficult to comprehend. While dropping the Stuyvesant High School diploma is infrequent, the students who choose to do so often include conflicts with language courses as a part of their reasoning. While Stuy Aprendamos is not a definitive solution to these issues, it is an effort to shift some of these patterns in a positive manner. Stuy Aprendamos will promote comfortability in the classroom through enjoyable, conversational experiences. A large part of understanding how a language operates is through cultural immersion which is often missing in class due to time constraints. Stuy Aprendamos aims to offer what the classroom cannot. Additionally, Spanish is the fourth most popular language in the world with 534 million speakers globally, 41 million nationally, and around 2 million in this city. Fluency in secondary languages is undeniably a valuable skill set. Stuy Aprendamos aims to prepare its members to become global citizens and respectable alums of our institution.",,"The President and Founder of the Club are largely in charge of logistical and administrational concerns such as resourcing and communication. The Vice President is largely in charge of organizing events/meetings. While the descriptions listed assign certain tasks to the President and Vice President, there is heavy collaboration and overlap between tasks. In addition to these positions, once the club is chartered, Stuy Aprendamos will recruit members interested in attaining leadership positions. The positions available as of right now are the Social Media Manager, the Outreach Manager, and the Event Manager. The Social Media Manager will be in charge of expanding the presence once pages are fully developed. They will also be in charge of recording and sharing highlights of our experiences at Stuy Aprendamos. The Outreach Manager is in charge of recruiting members on an interpersonal level. Lastly, the Event Manager will work closely with the Vice President to plan and carry out meetings. These three positions will be available once Stuy Aprendamos begins operating. The positions are open to those who are general members. Members must fill out applications (through Google Forms) that list their credibility. The President and Vice President will then allocate roles.

Members are expected to follow Stuyvesant's existing codes of conduct. On top of that, given that this is a cultural club, members are expected to act in respective and appreciative manners toward other cultures. If members indicate signs of disrespect in any form, they will be immediately kicked out. These codes of conduct apply to leaders as well.

Given that it is the President and Vice President's final year at Stuyvesant, the current leadership positions will be assigned to underclassmen who can assume these roles after having gained enough experience. If leaders neglect their tasks or disrespect the values of Stuy Aprendamos, they will be removed by the President and/or Vice President immediately on StuyActivies, and a general member that shows initiative will assume the role as soon as possible. Leaders' titles will be removed from the activities page by me. They will also be removed from any social media pages (Facebooks groups, Instagram, etc.), and an announcement will be made to all members regarding their concerns. A follow-up application for the vacant role will be distributed amongst members.","Stuy Aprendamos brings about another way to experience and appreciate other cultures that has most likely never been done so before. Students will come to enjoy the process of learning another language through incredibly fun and interesting experiences. They will play games like Loteria, a Spanish version of bingo that improves vocabulary and listening. They will try delicious dishes from other cuisines. Through Stuy Aprendamos, students will find themselves feeling more connected to various parts of the world all while attaining an impressive skill set.","Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but there will be up to two meetings monthly.","['tuesday', 'wednesday']",low,"['spanish', 'language', 'cultural']",Stuy Aprendamos is not a Hispanic Student League.

Mu Alpha Theta Stuy,mualphathetastuy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/mualphathetastuy/112e5fed,"To provide recognition and opportunity based on mathematical skill.
","The purpose of this organization is to maintain the chapter of Mu Alpha Theta at Stuyvesant, which is the National High School and Two-Year College Mathematics Honor Society. This will recognize students who excel at mathematics in Stuyvesant, and allow for students to participate in mathematics related events and competitions. Many students in Stuyvesant who enjoy math do not get the chance to participate in math team, so we are providing an opportunity for a dedicated group of members to gather in meetings to discuss mathematical related events, and to compete in regional or national math contests. Outstanding achievements by students will be rewarded with awards, scholarships, and grants to students or their faculty advisor. Not only will the students be able to interact with others who enjoy math in the school, but students will be connected across the country in a national convention organized by the main chapter of Mu Alpha Theta.
","Mu Alpha Theta will work to provide avid math students with opportunities that they would not have without this club. Currently in Stuyvesant, there is no other club like Mu Alpha Theta, which can help such a broad spectrum of eager students. Some of Mu Alpha Theta meetings will be outside of school, such as in museums, which will expose members to new fields and perspectives of math. Members can also meet members from other charters and share ideas. This is one of the biggest benefits of Mu Alpha Theta. Mu Alpha Theta is a large organization with chapters throughout the nation. This will allow Stuyvesant students to connect with students with the same passion from across the United States. This club ensures that all members are dedicated and will continue to further their mathematical knowledge. This includes math competitions to keep members on top of their game and improving. Meetings are beneficial, not only because members would learn from club leaders, but also among each other, which brings everyone in the club up. Members of Mu Alpha Theta are also eligible for special awards, scholarships, and grants provided by the organization. Thus, Mu Alpha Theta will promote the enjoyment of mathematics. 
",,"The Stuyvesant Mu Alpha Theta chapter will have four leadership positions: 2 Co-Presidents, 1 VP of Internal Affairs, and 1 VP of External Affairs. 

The officers for this year have already been chosen. In all future years, open positions for officers will be chosen by an application basis. With approval from the faculty advisor, non-graduating officers will be guaranteed the position they had in previous years; however if they choose to seek a different or higher office, they, as regular members, would be chosen on an application basis. By running for a higher or different office, candidates renounce their claim to the position they have had the previous year (e.g., if a student was VP of Internal Affairs the previous year and they decide to run for Co-President the next year, they are not guaranteed their position of VP Internal. If they lose the election for Co-President, they cannot turn back to their previous office.) All current members can apply for an officer position, which will then be voted on by all members of the club. The candidate with the plurality of votes will be elected to the position. At the discretion of the faculty advisor, a prospective applicant can be vetoed for any reason. Similarly, the faculty advisor will also have the power to break ties in these elections (the faculty advisor can also choose to break ties with runoff elections). 

If a member decides that an officer (either a President or Vice President) is not fulfilling their role, they can bring it up at a meeting. If another member seconds the challenge, then the officers, excluding the one being charged, will vote on whether or not he should be removed. If there is a unanimous decision for removal, then the officer will be removed from office, otherwise, the officer will be able to keep their position. The agreement of both Presidents and the Faculty Advisor also has the power to remove VPs. In the case of a removal, an officer can appoint a member; if at least half of the officers approve the appointment, the appointee will become an officer. In the event that a President is removed, one of the other officers will take his place, potentially with a vote among all members if necessary, and a replacement officer will be appointed. 
","The thing that makes Mu Alpha Theta Stuy unique is that there is no other branch of the national math honors society here at Stuyvesant, and this provides a unique opportunity to recognize students who excel in the field of mathematics. It is only fitting that these students receive some honor for their hard work. This club will also broaden the outreach programs of the Stuyvesant Math Teams, by including more students in various competitive math areas.

Model Kit Club,modelkitclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/modelkitclub/7dbf51e8,The Model Kit Club aims to create a community for model kit builders and enthusiasts to build and discuss various model kits in a relaxed space.,"The purpose of the Model Kit Club is to create a community for model kit builders and enthusiasts to share their interest in this hobby with others, to build models with other members, introduce the various techniques and tools used in model kit building to new builders, and to foster a safe, welcoming, and fun environment to all who enjoy model kits. The club will provide tools, model kit sets, and space for members to work together and complete kits of various themes, including, but not limited to vehicles, military equipment, and Gundam. The club will also provide instruction for new and inexperienced builders, such as proper use of various tools like safety and cleanup procedures, nippers and hobby knives, sanding techniques, application of decals and stickers, painting, and other assembly techniques. The club will display members' completed kits within the school building where possible. The club is committed to ensuring everyone enjoys model kit building with the company of others. Members are expected to respect their peers, including respecting the tools and kits provided by the club, respecting others' building space, handling sharp objects carefully, and abiding by school rules at all times. Members are not to keep completed kits at home and all kits are property of the Model Kit Club and/or the Stuyvesant Student Union.
","The Model Kit Club will benefit the Stuyvesant community by providing a space for people who enjoy model kit building, military history, Gunpla, arts and crafts. A very big bonus is the opportunity to hone one's art and motor skills as many kits require a very delicate hand to handle parts smaller than your fingernail and proficiency in use of color and detail. Some examples of skills members will learn are basic ones like use of nippers, intermediate ones like sanding, and advanced ones like painting. Another benefit of this club is the fact that members will not be alone while building their kit. Typically, amateur model kit builders will build and learn on their own through trial and error and online tutorials and reviews. However, in this club, students will have experienced builders who can teach and assist in techniques to improve the build. They can also learn from their peers on what equipment they should use instead of having to purchase and test out different products and tools which will lead to saving a good amount of money and hassle. Members will also pay zero to just a fraction of the cost of each kit and equipment as the club will cover much of the expenses, and if everyone chips in a few dollars, the costs can easily be covered. Why pay 50 dollars or more with the hassle of purchasing it yourself when you can chip in no more than five dollars and build the kit with friends right in Stuyvesant? It can also be a bonding experience for many who hold this hobby, and an easier way to make friends as the club will consist of others who share the same interests as them. The Model Kit Club will not discriminate and will allow model kit enthusiasts from brand new builders to veteran collectors to participate in activities, which will range from easier builds to more difficult ones for anyone up for a challenge.",https://sites.google.com/stuy.edu/stuymkc/,"Every year, new leaders will be appointed by a collective decision from the existing leaders. The decision among the leaders must be unanimous for the new leaders to be appointed. If the leaders are unable to come to a decision then an election among all the nominees will be held. All nominees will be required to fill out an application to provide a better background to their growth as a model kit builder and their capability as a leader, as leader positions require many skills, including managing the funds used to buy tools and model kits, hold meetings that require a lot of organization, and communicate with members to ensure inexperienced builders get help from experienced builders when needed.
The impeachment process must be initiated by a leader of the club, but members are always allowed to report a leader to the other leaders confidentially, upon which the leadership board will choose a plan of action. Once a leader initiates the impeachment process, if half of the members vote to have the leader in question removed, the impeachment will go through. Otherwise, there will be no change, but the leadership board will work to resolve the issue without an impeachment.","Model kit building is a rare hobby. Furthermore, there are many genres of model kits, from military vehicles and equipment to Gundam robots. No other club at Stuyvesant focuses on this hobby, so anyone who already has an interest in this club can find others who like it and those who would like to get into it can ease their way in. Also, the opportunity to actually build many model kits is rare, as high-quality kits are pricey and require a lot of time. This club is bringing a small but awesome hobby to Stuyvesant.",The club will meet on Friday every week from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM.,['friday'],low,"['model', 'kit', 'gundam']","The most unique part about our club is the opportunity we will provide to have a first-hand building experience within Stuyvesant.

We invest in the musical talents of our club members who work to entertain the masses as well as encouraging members to create new friends as they master their kazoo skills as there are basically no constrictions to how the kazoo can be played. Our activities inspire creativity and quick thinking as on-the-spot performances are very common, so we will progressively raise our members' self-esteem and confidence to interact with everything and everyone around them. Additionally, Our members can openly practice singing and gain more control over their voice. Creativity is the foundation of our club and we wish to share that with others.

Stuyvesant MUA Club,stuymua,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuymua/484c72b4," Our mission is to teach beginners basic makeup skills, hygiene, and history and allow those who can already do makeup to flourish their skills. 
","The purpose is to share knowledge on the basics of makeup such as skin prep, shade match, application techniques, and hygiene. We also want others to know the difference between different types of makeup such as theatrical vs in-person vs on-camera, makeup ingredients, and how it has evolved through history. Our purpose is to uplift those who are interested in makeup and show them how they can enhance their own beauty instead of creating an artificial mask. 

Makeup is a wonderful form of artistic expression. While art doesn't have a set of rules, it does have a theory. In today's world, where there are so many products, it’s difficult to know what's suitable for one's skin, especially if one is a beginner. In this club, we wish to teach those who are beginners how to identify their skin type (oily, dry or combination), undertone (cool, warm, or neutral), and tone (light to dark.) Additionally, we also want to demonstrate the various methods of application (i.e. brushes vs sponge vs cushion) and let each individual decide what suits them the best. 

 Different types of makeup are done depending on the event. Do you just want to master a quick everyday routine for school? Are you going to a special party where you want to be glammed up? Will you be performing on stage? Or do you just want to learn how to conceal your blemishes? Here, we will be discussing the best ways to do one’s makeup for each specific event. 
 In addition to that, this club will teach the history of how each culture did makeup, where each mainstream product originated from, and the different types of ingredients and application methods used throughout history. 

Most importantly, we will be teaching basic makeup hygiene, which, unfortunately, isn’t talked about a lot. The whole point of makeup is to enhance one’s beauty and you definitely don’t want bacteria from unclean tools and cross-contaminated products on your face. We will demonstrate the best way to clean makeup tools, including tips and tricks regarding if you’re doing makeup on multiple others using the same set of tools. 

To summarize, the purpose of this club is to uplift individuals who are interested in makeup by learning about products, applications, hygiene, and history. The goal is not to create an artificial mask but to enhance one’s natural beauty and form of self-expression.
","This club will benefit Stuyvesant in the following ways: 
1. There are many individuals in school who are interested in makeup but don’t know how to do it or want to improve their skills. This club fulfills their needs since we both teach beginners the basics and share ideas on different types of looks.
2. Stuyvesant High School hosts multiple performances throughout the year where performers are to wear makeup (such as Sing, stuysquad, SOS, etc.). Unfortunately, a lot of student-makeup artists working at such events don’t know standard hygiene such as using the same tools on everyone without cleaning in between. As we all know, makeup comes in contact with a lot of intimate parts of our face such as our eyes and not following proper hygiene causes a range of conditions from acne to infections such as conjunctivitis and sites, which can be incredibly dangerous. As mentioned above, there will be a huge emphasis on teaching proper hygiene in this club, which will hopefully make things much safer for students who are getting their makeup done. 
3. There are a lot of misconceptions regarding makeup such as fear-mongering about certain ingredients, where each product comes from and who it's meant for. Makeup has existed across various cultures in the world but people these days tend to only know about European history; I believe teaching Stuyvesant’s extremely diverse student body how their own countries and cultures contributed to the making of today’s mainstream makeup is incredibly validating. Additionally, there are certain stigmas surrounding makeup such as things like “it’s only meant for females” when in reality, people of all genders use makeup in today’s world (especially in the entertainment/performing arts industry) and have used it on a regular basis across the globe. 
",Instagram: @stuy_mua,"1. President: Expected to hold meetings, plan activities, and do budgeting. The president must be knowledgeable of the basics of makeup products, application, history and hygiene. The person who should be appointed as the president must be able to dedicate a good portion of their time to this club. When it’s time to pass down leadership, we will be looking for students who were present during 70% of our meetings, and be knowledgeable and skilled in makeup. If the current president doesn't meet these requirements and the members believe that the president should be impeached, the Vice president shall take the president's place and if there's no one left at the vice president's position, the director will take their position. For the director's position, an existing member of the club who has been a willing participant will be chosen. 

2. Vice president: Assist the leader when holding meetings and scouting new members. They should engage with the club members and give suggestions and feedback to the president. It is preferred if they have intermediate knowledge and skills regarding basic makeup application and should be present during the majority of the meetings. This position will be appointed to those who want to take a leadership position for this club and it’s okay if the person isn’t as skilled in makeup but still show dedication. If the vice president consistently missed meetings without a valid excuse (i.e. 3-4 times consecutively) or other members believe isn't fulfilling their responsibility correctly, then they will be removed and the director shall take their place.

3. Director: This position will be appointed to those skilled in makeup but may not have enough time to take on the responsibilities of a president or vice president. Their primary responsibility will be to assist beginners while they do their own makeup so as long as they show up 2-3x a month, they will be fine. If they have missed 4 meetings consecutively without a valid excuse, the president or vice president will remove them from their position. 

For the appointment of all the positions mentioned above, a form will be sent out when it's time for board member change and the existing board members will pick their successors based on the criteria mentioned above.","Currently, Stuyvesant doesn’t have any club that teaches how to do makeup or any place for existing makeup artists to show their work and give feedback to each other.
This club will be a place where students can learn and use these skills long after they graduate from Stuyvesant, and have a newfound confidence in themselves too. If they’re passionate about it, the club will help students who want to become professional makeup artists by teaching them hygiene standards, giving them the chance to try out a wide variety of products, and allowing them to practice on other people.

There are three categories of events: Health Science Events, Health Professional Events, Emergency Preparedness Events, Leadership Events, and Teamwork Events. Each event has its own subcategory you can compete in. The health science events include Behavioral Health, Pathophysiology, Pharmacology, Dental Terminology, Human Growth and Development, Medical Reading, Medical Terminology, Health Informatics, and much more. The Health professional events include Biomedical Laboratory Science, Clinical Nursing, Clinical Specialty, Medical Assisting, Sports Medicine, and others. The Emergency Preparedness Events include CPR/First Aid, Epidemiology, and Public Health. The Leadership Events are comprised of Health Lifestyle, Prepared Speaking, Research Poster, and more. Lastly, the Teamwork Events include Community Awareness, Forensic Science, Healthy Career Display, Health Education, and Public Service announcements. HOSA also provides a unique program of leadership development, motivation, and recognition exclusively for students enrolled in health science education and biomedical science programs or who have interests in pursuing careers in health professions. It also actively promotes career opportunities in the health industry and enhances the delivery of quality health care to all people. 
","Stuyvesant HOSA is tremendously valuable to the Stuyvesant community as it provides students with aspirations in the medical field with opportunities to further delve in. HOSA also intends to introduce students to other students who share their interests, allowing for meaningful connections. Additionally, HOSA aims to teach prospective medical students various subjects involved in the path to practicing medicine. This knowledge they will gain will be tested in competitions to assess their understanding and application of their knowledge. These competitions will be at the state and international levels. It will give students opportunities to achieve prestigious awards to polish their skills and achieve a sense of accomplishment. It will also be of benefit to those who further their studies in pursuing health professions. HOSA also helps students with time management skills, working with a group or team, and skills in communication. HOSA will also benefit students’ leadership skills which would help with their personal development and academic success allowing them to become the best they can if they pursue a career in a health profession. The activities will also help students build confidence, motivation, and enthusiasm for medicine. Lastly, students will develop an understanding of current healthcare issues and awareness of environmental concerns through competitions and meetings allowing for more informed decisions.

The Presidents are expected to plan meetings, moderate the meetings, teach the curriculum to the members, prepare the students for the competitions, and make long-term decisions for the club. The secretary will be in a more day-to-day position, where they will help manage the meetings, assess the group's understanding of concepts, ask questions that require further clarification, bring in new members, and find ways to improve the organization. More leadership positions will open based on their need and will be appointed based on applications at the end of this school year. People competing for a position will be randomly interviewed and ranked based on their applications. Once selected, the members will receive training from the counterparts they are planning to replace. Leaders will be impeached if they do not complete their tasks more than three times. Members are expected to attend most meetings as HOSA is a serious organization that functions for the majority of members. Members are further expected to engage in a respectful and accepting manner. ","This organization is unique because it promotes a wide variety of things that are not seen in combination for many other clubs. For example, HOSA promotes teamwork, leadership, community service, and community awareness alongside academic knowledge related to medicine. Unlike other organizations, this is an officially recognized chapter giving value to its authenticity. HOSA provides its members with opportunities to grow their skills for their careers in the future. Lastly, this is the only medical club that allows students to test their knowledge in competitions.

","The SDC aims to foster an environment where students can find community in their enjoyment of the mystery genre as well as stimulate their minds with the variety of mystery media presented in the club. In a school where coursework, club commitments, and even relationships can be formulaic, members are given the chance to exercise their intellectual creativity not only by watching or playing mystery books, movies, shows, and games but also by creating their own mysteries. Over the course of the school year, SDC members will participate in one large mystery-making project, whether it may be a diorama of a crime, a mystery short story, or a scavenger hunt across different clubs. The members will also have opportunities for cross-club contact as they collaborate on projects. We hope our members can learn more about the puzzle world and the different types of mysteries that exist in the most unsuspecting corners.","SDC's detectives will engage in many mystery-related activities to relax and engage the mind. The club takes into account Stuyvesant's rigorous work schedule and will provide a space where its members can relax by enjoying mystery media such as mystery shows and movies, reading mystery books or playing mystery games. They will have projects throughout the school year where SDC's detectives will create their own mysteries like dioramas, virtual escape rooms, or simple puzzles. Not only will SDC take note of and enrich a member's deduction skills, they will also keep the creative and artistic capabilities of members at the forefront of every meeting. Members can find other people to connect with over their shared interests, which can start with mysteries but aren't necessarily limited to it. Members can also share and enjoy a wide range of mystery media with friends after a long day of classes, unwinding while still keeping their analytical skills sharp. Meetings will be a learning experience to not only mold members into more creative thinkers who consider all of what they are given in a problem but to also broaden their horizons, as the mystery genre is fond of those with a broad spectrum of interests and a wealth of knowledge about those interests.",,"The club will strive to have as little of a hierarchy as possible, although one is necessary for arrangement of new meetings as well as upholding an environment of inclusivity and community. Founders and dedicated members will have access to administrative permissions in order to fulfill these obligations. If a member is found to be violating these guidelines, either by inactivity—defined by showing up to less than a meeting per month— or by conflicting with another member either by way of discrimination or argument, they will receive a strike depending on the severity of their transgression without exception or regard for their position in the club. A dedicated member would be one who reliably participates by going to meetings and contributing to said meetings, e.g. providing suggestions for future meetings. Promotion is determined by a club-wide vote which can be initiated by any member, and a consensus of over 2/3rds of the club is required for decisions involving promotion.","The Stuy Detective Club (SDC) is unique because it involves the production of logic puzzles and centers around the mystery genre. It explores a multitude of mystery genres rather than focusing on a single topic.

Together, all of our members will be working to produce bi-weekly films that relate to the high school experience in general. We will follow a script turned into acting and filming process, and will release our production at the end of the 2 weeks. Our club’s idea may seem difficult to carry out, but we’ve created an organized schedule where it’s in a bi-weekly format and each department of the club only has 1 day of work they have to complete within those two weeks. This way, the workflow of the club will be smooth, the department members won’t feel any strain of work, and instead, they’ll have additional time to make more connections with those in our club.
","StuyCast will be beneficial to the Stuy community because it will provide a place for people to really find the potential within their talents and create something out of that along with other students. It will also provide a means of connection with many students within our grade because we will create stories that are relatable/engaging to many Stuy students just like us. We will also be keeping up with short news videos and informing our general audience in various ways and a short amount of time. In turn, this will also allow many other students to find our club and hopefully find something that suits them.

As time goes on, they’ll become adept within that field and will even be able to teach new, incoming members in the future.

Our policy of electing leaders will act in accordance with the following formula: One half shall be elected through majority votes or written interviews and the other half shall be hand-picked by the club Presidents to create a baseline level of familiarity with their cabinet.
Appointing Leaders: 
The Overseer branch will act as the executives and will consist of: 2 Presidents, Chiefs of Staff, Secretary, and Supervisors. This branch will guide, manage, and create plans for the club. Of the 2 Presidents, one shall be elected by a majority vote within only the Overseer branch, while the other shall be elected through a majority vote within the club as a whole through ranked choice voting. 
Pertaining to the rest of the Overseer branch, half shall be elected through selection by written interviews while the other half shall be hand-picked by both Presidents. This rule applies to both our Producers and Club Foundation branches as well. 

Impeaching Leaders:
If more than 5 reports are made about any one of our leaders by our club members, then, the Overseer branch shall contact that specific leader to work out the issue. Even after that, if they continue getting complaints, we shall give them their first of two strikes. If the leader is found still not complying with the expectations of our members, we must give them their second strike and move into the impeachment process. 
In this case, unless it is a President in question, the leader’s department members and club Overseers will do a majority vote to decide their impeachment as leader. If at least 45% of voters agree to impeachment, then the leader shall be put down from their position. 
If it is a President in question of impeachment, then, we will do a club-wide vote denouncement. If a 40% vote majority is reached, then, the President shall be impeached. The threshold for impeachment is so low because we want our club to be led at optimal effort by its leaders, especially the Presidents.","StuyCast prioritizes group work and producing an environment where students specialized in different areas are able to collaborate to publish a shared production. Rather than focusing on a specific skill to work upon,we will be a club focusing on multiple at once. StuyCast not only benefits the club members themselves, but also provides students outside the club to also experience what our club does and gives them something to look forward to every two weeks!","StuyCast’s meetings will be based on a 2-week schedule.

Students are able to gain first hand knowledge of civil and criminal law and courtroom procedures.

Each year the Mock Trial team competes in The New York State High School Mock Trial Program in which the team is given a case that will be used for the rest of the year in scrimmages and the official competition. This case includes the rules, testimonies, evidence, and legal doctrine required for the competition and students will prepare cases and assign roles based on what section they are in.

The team is split up into 3 sections: the prosecution attorneys, defense attorneys, and witnesses.

Prosecution attorneys represent the state or the entity who are levying allegations and defense attorneys represent the person or entity who is being charged with the allegations. Both prosecution and defense attorneys will work with their witnesses to prep for questioning and prepare their own cross examination questionings. Each side is also be expected to give an opening and closing statement in which they will present a large part of their case.

Witnesses will play the roles of the different characters in the case who are being questioned during the trial simulation. These witnesses will either be prosecution or defense witnesses in which they testify on one of the sides and are given an affidavit that describes their standpoint on the case. Attorneys and witnesses will work together as witnesses will not only participate in questioning from their corresponding sides' attorney, but also be involved in a cross examination from the other side.""","Stuyvesant Mock Trial Team will give students the opportunity to experience the courtroom for themselves through real trial simulations and case preparation. Members will gain skills in professional and public speaking and also learn important topics like civics, ethics, civility, and legal doctrine. Usually the competition is held in official courtrooms and the team collaborates with practicing attorneys who help the members cultivate their skills and also gives them insight on legal practice in the real world. This organization aims to help Stuyvesant students learn more about the legal field through hands-on learning and experience and to build connections with other high school students interested in this activity within New York State. For those interested in pursuing a career in the legal field later on, Stuyvesant Mock Trial is a great opportunity to learn from those involved in the field as our partners and the judges for the competition are either practicing attorneys or judges themselves in official trials. Stuyvesant Mock Trial teams partner with prestigious legal firms like Cravath, Swaine & Moore -- which also gives students the chance to experience traveling to the firm and having guest speaker panels with other lawyers at the firm. Even for those students not interested in continuing into the legal field, this experience provides them a valuable experience and educational opportunity to learn the intricacies and procedures of the courtroom as well as navigating the legal sphere.",https://nysba.org/nys-mock-trial/,"""The leadership positions for the club will be the co-presidents of the club and the section leaders for the Attorneys and the Witnesses. The co-presidents should be selected from the section leaders who will act as both the presidents as well as leaders of their individual teams. These positions will be determined by the faculty advisor and the current presidents and there may be a transfer of leadership if one of the members in a leadership position graduates, steps down, or is impeached.

Co-presidents are responsible for arranging scrimmages and organizing competition logistics including travel expenses, administration permissions, and registrations. They will also be responsible for communicating information about the competition and the club to its members.

Section leaders will be responsible for helping the members of their teams build their cases and will also communicate necessary information to them regarding the competition and team activities. The section leaders are also responsible for coordinating with each other to arrange scrimmages based on the availability of the other members. Finally, section leaders will also choose the participants from their team for each scrimmage and competition in collaboration with the faculty advisor who must approve the final roster.

In the event that one of the members in a leadership position neglects the responsibilities listed above or engages in inappropriate behavior using their authority any of the other members are allowed to raise an appeal for impeachment in which if it is approved by the faculty advisor will result in a team-wide vote on the issue. This vote will be facilitated by the faculty advisor and if 2/3 or more of the vote rules for the impeachment of that member, then they will be removed from their position and a replacement will be chosen.

The club’s primary goal is to expose its members to a variety of topics in physics for either competitive or research purposes. Since physics is taught later on in the Stuyvesant science curriculum, the club hopes to give eager students a chance to be introduced to the subject earlier on so they have more time to either compete or delve further into physics research topics by the time others are taking introductory physics in their junior year.

The Stuyvesant Physics Team also wishes to make the F=ma a more relevant competition in Stuyvesant, with more USAPhO qualifiers as a result. This will help increase Stuy’s glory as a competitive school by expanding into a different field.

The club would like to teach at a variety of difficulty levels to accommodate more members. In the end, the Stuyvesant Physics Team wants its members to be familiar with various physics concepts when they choose to explore them at a deeper level in high school or college. The club hopes to help students have a leg up in more advanced physics classes and be more enthusiastic about physics.","The Stuyvesant Physics Team serves students who want to be ahead in their future physics classes and learn more than what is taught in a regular class. The club believes that the Physics Team will also help the students learn about a topic they might be interested in studying further in the future. Mechanics and E&M, along with topics like thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, etc., are all helpful in their pursuit of physics. The club also hopes to get students ready for competitions like F=ma and PUPC. Through these competitions, students not only gain exposure to higher-level physics problems but also build a community through their teams and learn how to work together. If a student starts attending this club as a freshman or sophomore, they will have an edge in these competitions and can start performing well a year or two before their classmates. This earlier access to physics can also increase the chance of a student doing well enough on a physics competition to put it on their resumes/college applications. It is harder for students to manage these contests, especially online ones like the IPhO, as they head into junior and senior year, so starting off early could be very beneficial.",https://stuypht.org/  https://discord.com/channels/756532357808521318/756628948011712636,"""There are 3-4 captains in any given year, and one is removed either when they graduate or when they leave the club. The remaining captains will choose a new captain by interviewing members of the club who show interest in obtaining a leadership position. They will be selected based on their organizational ability and proficiency in physics. In the case where all 3-4 captains graduate in the same year, all new captains are chosen in the same way before graduation. Additional student teachers will be elected if needed through an application process. If impeachment is necessary, a vote will be held among all members of the team, where a majority decides the vote. All members and captains are expected to regularly attend meetings and contribute positively to the physics community within Stuyvesant. It is recommended that all students take the F=ma in January.

For instance, we hope to bring awareness to the violence in Kashmir, the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, the deforestation and flooding in Pakistan, the land erosion in Bangladesh, and the lack of clean water in Afghanistan. SAYA also plans to bring awareness to important social issues affecting the region such as girls’ education, domestic violence, rape, child marriages, colorism, etc. However, we plan to have this club serves as a space where people celebrate the diversity of South Asia while acknowledging the conflicts affecting it. Each South Asian nation, even specific districts, has their own idiosyncratic set of values, festivals, and traditions. We aim to hold meetings and commemorate such diversity by celebrating and learning about festivals from each region. Among these festivals are Diwali (festival of lights) from India, Pohela Boishakh (Bengali New Year), Basant (spring festival) in Pakistan, Fagun Purnima (festival of colors) in Nepal, Now Ruz (Afghani New Year), and many more. Aside from festivals, we also plan on hosting movie nights and meetings with games, food, dance, and music from each nation. SAYA will also discuss the historical struggle each nation (i.e, imperialism, foreign control) faced, each nation’s political and economic relationship with one another, and we will also celebrate their Independence Day. As a SPARK club, our ultimate community (and non-South Asian) communities have a safe and fun space to learn about their cultures and celebrate their uniqueness. ","Stuyvesant SAYA works to benefit the Stuy community by giving South Asian students a chance to learn about and celebrate the countries they are from. For many students, Stuyvesant’s notorious culture of being very competitive and at times cutthroat, can be overwhelming. SAYA is a safe haven that provides a break from this atmosphere and give students the opportunity to appreciate/discuss their heritage and where non-South Asian students can learn about the diversity of the region. Not only will they learn about such diversity, students will also be in constant interaction with one another by watching movies, playing games (both traditional games such as ludo and online games such as jeopardy/kahoot that will test their knowledge). As a SPARK club, we also make it our goal to discuss issues directly affecting the Stuyvesant student body such as mental health, substance abuse, etc. SAYA will also ensure that its members volunteer in local events in and around Stuyvesant. Most importantly, the South Asian Youth Association will allow the Stuyvesant South Asian student body to be comfortable in their own skin and to appreciate the history of their ancestors. SAYA allows a time and place for students to learn about their own culture through fun and meaningful experiences. The Stuyvesant community will definitely benefit from SAYA as it will give many kids a sense of belonging and understanding of their culture and themselves.",,"SAYA will consist of the following board positions, and members will be given a chance to apply for positions through a google form application that will be reviewed by seniors on current board :

-President: The president will oversee the club meetings and ensure that the rest of the board members are doing their tasks appropriately. The president will serve as the medium between the rest of the board and the faculty advisor, Mr. Angel Colon. It is the president's job to make sure that each South Asian country is represented accordingly and respectively. They are also in charge of coming up with new and engaging ideas for meetings to keep the club interesting for all members.

-Vice President: The vice president will essentially have the same duties and rights as the president and will make sure that the club runs smoothly. The vice president will take the place of a president if the president is absent from a meeting.

-Secretary: The secretary will be present at most (if not every) meetings and it is their duty to take minutes and send it to our faculty advisor, Mr. Angel Colon. Moreover, the secretary will record the general ideas and information discussed during board meetings, keep track of attendance and update the information accordingly, and will contact board members if they fail to meet the requirements. It is also the secretary’s responsibility to actively promote the club.

-Events Coordinator: The events coordinator’s duty is to actively promote the club, both online and offline. The events coordinator create posters for the club, update social media accounts (Facebook page and website), reserve rooms in advance for meetings. Furthermore, he or she will also have to promote the club, reach out to new members, and keep in touch with our country representatives for future events.

Impeachment Protocols:
We plan to implement a three strike system. We will have a shared spreadsheet with all the board members where they can check if they have a strike and request appeals.
If a board member receives three strikes, he/she will be impeached. Each of the following will result in a deduction:
-Do not attend three consecutive board meetings or regular meetings in a row.
-fail to notify president/other board members about why they are missing from a certain meeting. Failure to do so will result in a 0.5 strike.
-fail to complete their duties sufficiently and do not show dedication over the course of three weeks.","Though Stuyvesant has a 70% Asian population, many South Asians feel left out because the term “asian” usually refers to people from East Asia. We hope to create a space where South Asian heritage is celebrated and accurately represented. Thus far, there have been no clubs that focus on diversity and culture of South Asia. We aim to not only focus on culture, but also explore how our South Asian identity shapes our American identity. We want to allow and give students a space to be comfortable with their identity and showcase their pride in multiple forms.

Luckily, we have a skatepark right next to Stuy, so you won’t have to travel too far. If you don’t have a skateboard, then I would highly recommend getting one, but there are a few extras. If anyone is into graphic design and wants to design a Stuy skate sticker to help fund for boards then that would be awesome. Stuy skate is welcome to anyone that wants to learn how to skate, regardless of skill level. Even if you don’t know how to push on a board, I guarantee you that you will be able to ride down a small ramp within 20 minutes if you try hard enough. For anyone that is interested, I think it would be cool if we could make a skate video with the club by the end of the year.","At a school like Stuy, where homework can be a lot sometimes, it is important to get outside and exercise as much as possible. Skating is a great way to clear your mind and focus on something other than your math test tomorrow. Skating is also a great way to make new friends that share a common interest. Especially for beginners, having friends to skate with can lead to the most progression. This club intends to be a place for skaters to fine tune their craft, and learn from one another. All members are encouraged to upload videos of themselves skating to a shared google drive. Even if it is just an attempt at an ollie or riding of a curb, it would be cool to have a shared collection of videos to look at and add to. Also, if you try to take and add as many videos as you can, then you will notice improvement overtime. If it is raining, we can have a meeting inside and watch a skate video or just hang out. For those of you that like listening to music when you skate, we can make a group playlist for listening to other people’s music.",,"The graphic designer will be responsible for creating a logo/sticker for stuy skate. Anyone who has experience with graphic design is eligible to do this. The videographer/person with a good phone camera (or better, an actual camera) will be assisting in taking videos of members skating and editing the videos. All members of Stuy skate are expected to have their own skateboards or borrow one from a friend. Exceptions may occur, but as a general rule, bring your skateboard to skate club. All members are encouraged to submit at least one video of themselves skating. We can watch these on rainy days, and try to give tips to one another for certain tricks. In terms of transferring leadership between school years, anyone that regularly attends meetings is invited to apply for an available leadership position. Some of these positions can hold multiple people, such as the videographer(s) and graphic designer(s). If a member or leader of the club wishes to impeach a leader, then a vote will be held and if 50% of the club or more (votes including members) wishes to impeach the leader, then said leader will be impeached and barred from rejoining.","There is currently no skating club at Stuyvesant which by definition makes it unique. Skateboarding is one of the best communities I’ve ever had the privilege to be a member of. Skateboarding fosters lifelong friendships, support and physical activity. We hope to create an everlasting community at Stuyvesant that is just a leaf of the tree that is skateboarding from the global perspective.

Culture Is Power,cultureispower,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/cultureispower/d79299e2,To celebrate the power of art. Art defies geographic borders by working across disciplines creating dialogue between political and religious conflict.,"Expensive Saudi museums and art initiatives to counter reputational damage. State-supported creative industries in South Korea to foster innovation and enhance its international image. Travelling productions of the Bolshoi Ballet outside Russia and a network of overseas exhibition spaces of the Hermitage Museum in the Netherlands, Italy, Lithuania, and the UK. Culture Is Power. Art remains an influential part of global culture and international relations, but most people do not realize its critical role in our world today. Culture is more than simply dance, or painting, or music, it is utilized everyday internationally as soft power. This club celebrates the influence of the arts on global cultures and communities. Art and culture defy geographic boundaries by working across disciplines and sectors to create dialogue in the face of geopolitical and religious conflict. This club aims to bring together those who have an interest in politics or art (or both) and create a space where they can discuss their complex interrelation. Every month, either a guest speaker will talk about their work in art/culture and how they perceive its impact on global issues and international relations or we will pick an article on the importance of art and culture on geopolitics and international relations to discuss in the following meeting. ","Students can tend to be funneled into narrow subjects areas, but creativity and innovation often happen at the dynamic overlap between disciplines. Some think that what Stuy students learn everyday is solely in order to hold a diploma or get into a good college, and although this is important, Stuy students can learn to digest information in new ways by thinking about the world as it actually works. This club explores the collaborative power of interdisciplinary work in the arts and how it influences international relations, geopolitics and global conflict. Culture will encourage students to take ideas that are generated in class and explore them freely across formal subject boundaries. Guest speakers will bring fascinating, insider perspectives on careers in art & politics and thought-provoking narratives on art's role in politics and international relations. Successful international relations stem from the ability to escape brittle ways of thinking and learn from someone else's viewpoint. Furthermore, the Stuy community can take important lessons from the way artists see the world and interpret events. As in UN Secretary-General António Guterres' address to the General Assembly on 20 September 2022, 'Our world is in peril – and paralyzed...But the reality is that we live in a world where the logic of cooperation and dialogue is the only path forward...We need a coalition of the world.' Culture is Power invites students interested in the power of interdisciplinary creative studies to fight global challenges.",,"Presidents will ask for applications and interview and nominate exceptional candidates for elections. All members of the club will vote for their next president. Continuity and long term sustainability is important for the Stuy student body. Unless one or both of the presidents formally renounce leadership, they may serve as presidents for the following academic year if they do not leave Stuyvesant until graduation. In this case, the voting procedure will be carried out similarly. Vice presidents of Internal Events, Communications, and Public Outreach are nominated by the presidents and approved by all members. The Vice President of Internal Events is responsible for planning meetings and creating presentations and lessons. The Vice President of Communications manages the social media platforms, emails, and connecting with the SU/other clubs/rest of the school. The Vice President of Public Outreach facilitates reaching out to other charters and potential guest speakers while advertising to and helping recruit future student body members. If executives violate the rules, they will be subject to impeachment, requiring a petition from members, and removal, requiring a two-thirds majority.","Culture Is Power will be an innovative interdisciplinary thinkspace to explore the influence of art and culture on global issues and international relations. Art is a powerful tool for activism and dialogue. As Proust says “It is only through art that we can escape from ourselves and know how another person sees a universe which is not the same as our own”, the very concept that can lead to empathy and understanding in geopolitics and international relations. Yet art and culture are primary tools of statecraft, even though their influence often goes unrecognized. No other Stuy organization explores the massive impact of art and culture on politics and international relations. 

Culture Is Power will create a thought provoking blog to document discussions, disseminate research and pursue explorative journeys. Culture Is Power will develop and pilot micro-activism projects to test new ideas and methodologies in order to impact local communities at Stuyvesant stemming from discussions, research and explorations at club meeting.",The club will meet 1-3 times a month.

Moot Court,mootcourt,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/mootcourt/448048fc,Stuyvesant Moot Court Team is dedicated to developing public speaking skills and knowledge of the legal field through simulated Supreme Court trials.,"Stuyvesant Moot Court focuses on simulating Supreme Court trials in order to build skills in public speaking, argumentation, and professionalism. Students are able to gain first hand knowledge of government and Supreme Courtroom procedures.

Each year the Moot Court team competes in The New York State High School Moot Court Competition in which the team is given a case that will be used for the rest of the season in scrimmages and the official competition. This case includes the rules, testimonies, and decisions from lower court judges and students will prepare cases and assign roles based on what side and what issue they are arguing.

The team is split up into 2 sections: the prosecution and the defense.

Prosecution speakers represent the state or the entity who are levying allegations of violating the constitution and defense speakers represent the person or entity who is being charged with the allegations. Each side will consist of two speakers (one for each issue) that will prepare a speech to give and also prepare for judge questioning which can occur during the presentation.","Stuyvesant Moot Court Team will give students the opportunity to experience Supreme court procedures for themselves through real trial simulations and case preparation. Members will gain skills in professional and public speaking and also learn important topics like civics, ethics, civility, and governmental precedent. Usually the competition is held in official courtrooms and the team collaborates with practicing attorneys who help the members cultivate their skills and also gives them insight on how the Supreme Court makes decisions on issues. This organization aims to help Stuyvesant students learn more about legal doctrine, but more importantly the government through hands-on learning and experience and to build connections with other high school students interested in this activity within New York State. For those interested in pursuing a career in the legal field later on, Stuyvesant Moot Court is a great opportunity to learn from those involved in the field as our partners and the judges for the competition are either practicing attorneys or judges themselves in official trials. Stuyvesant Moot Court teams partner with prestigious legal firms like Cravath, Swaine & Moore -- which also gives students the chance to experience traveling to the firm and having guest speaker panels with other lawyers at the firm. Even for those students not interested in continuing into the legal field, this experience provides them a valuable experience and educational opportunity to learn the intricacies and procedures of legal doctrine as well as navigating the legal sphere.",,"The leadership positions for the club will be the team leaders or presidents of the club. These positions will be determined by the faculty advisor and the current presidents and there may be a transfer of leadership if one of the members in a leadership position graduates, steps down, or is impeached. Presidents are responsible for arranging scrimmages and organizing competition logistics including travel expenses, administration permissions, and registrations. They will also be responsible for communicating information about the competition and the club to its members and obtaining annual funding with the input of the faculty advisor. Finally, Presidents will also choose the participants from their team for each scrimmage and competition in collaboration with the faculty advisor who must approve the final roster. In the event that one of the members in a leadership position neglects the responsibilities listed above or engages in inappropriate behavior using their authority any of the other members are allowed to raise an appeal for impeachment in which if it is approved by the faculty advisor will result in a team-wide vote on the issue. This vote will be facilitated by the faculty advisor and if 2/3 or more of the vote rules for the impeachment of that member, then they will be removed from their position and a replacement will be chosen. However, this does not mean that the member is removed from the team as that is at the discretion of the remaining leaders and the faculty advisor.","This is currently Stuyvesant's only representation in the New York State High School Moot Court Program. We hope to be competing every year and participating in scrimmages with other high schools' Moot Court teams. Stuyvesant once had a Moot Court team, but it was discontinued for a period of time. Luckily, it has been restarted with the efforts of Ms. Shuman-- the club faculty advisor. Today, the Stuyvesant Moot Court team provides a unique opportunity for students to learn critical public speaking skills and also understand the fundamentals of our government's judicial system. Supreme Court trials are a completely unique form of argumentation as students are presenting in front of a panel of judges and learning presentation skills that go beyond argumentation.","Our meeting schedule will usually ramp up before the competition season which takes place around February each year, but meetings will be once or twice a week.

Stuyvesant Cubers Club,stuycubers,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuycubers/75f12b87,We want to create a community within Stuyvesant for people who are interested in solving and learning about Rubik's cubes. ,"This activity serves two main purposes, first it will be a place for those who are inexperienced in Rubik's cube solving yet interested to learn the process and techniques behind solving the Rubik's cube. Also, the club will serve as a place for those who are experienced at Rubik's cubes to become even better at their skills and also compete in a friendly manner against others who are also interested in solving Rubik's cubes. A Rubik's cube helps helps thinking abilities develop especially in teens. They develop hand-eye coordination as well as logic solving abilities which are important skills not just in games but also in the real world. Also, learning how to solve a Rubik's cube is a process that requires patience as well as listening abilities which are instilled into those who learn how to solve Rubik's cube. Rubik's cubes may just be a toy however they can instill many useful skills into the lives of our members.","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community because it provides a community for those who are interested in Rubik's cubes to come together. Stuyvesant is a very large school with thousands of members, so the fact of the matter is it's often hard for those who are interested in very niche subjects and projects to find communities that truly fit them and welcome them. However, if this club is accepted Rubik's cube solving will be much more accessible for those who are interested and Stuyvesant can have a proud community of cubers who are connected together in camaraderie associated with learning and practicing solving Rubik's cubes. Also, this club will serve as a place for us to hold speed-cubing competitions among students who are quite skilled. Those who are interested in solving Rubik's cubes but do not know all of the skills behind the process will be taught by our Rubik's mentors, and be able to practice among those who are at the same skill level as them. This will allow members of the Stuyvesant community to develop a new, popular skill that also strengthens their abilities in different skills for real world application. Anyone who is interested can go from someone who is completely inexperienced to someone who is a master at solving Rubik's cubes quickly.",,"The leadership positions are president, co-president, and there will also be Rubik's mentors. The president serves as the leader of the club who organizes meetings as well as leading the conversation and competitions about Rubik's cubes. The co-president serves as a support for the president as well as the manager of outreach in order to further grow the Rubik's cubes community and find those who are interested. Rubik's mentors are those who are quite skilled at the ability of solving Rubik's cubes and would like to use their skills to teach those who are interested in the topic but do not know hot to solve or would like to improve. The new president, co-president, and Rubik's members will be picked through google forms sent at the end of the year, and then applicants will be screened by the current president and co-president. If a leader is abusing the rules of the club the president and co-president will have a conversation with the leader and see how they can fix the situation. If this is not possible they would be removed from the club and not allowed to participate in our activities and competitions unless they prove that they can truly lead for the better.","Our organization is unique because it also teaches those who are interested in Rubik's cubes but not skilled to learn how to solve. Our focus is not just speed-cubing but also learning the entire process behind the solving, which will make this unique as it is a club you can join with 0 experience and still be able to make the absolute most of it. It is also unique because are planning to have long scale multi-week tournaments which will not just be very fun for members but also an interesting thing to keep Stuyvesant students engaged in the skill.","General meetings will take place on Thursday every 2 weeks, with varying meetings depending on the availability of members.

","Open Source Studio plans to create a dynamic coding club, where club members can learn not only various specific coding languages, but also will be able to create large-scale open-source projects with a variety of different coding fields. These would include web development, game development, and discord bot creation. People of all levels of coding experience are allowed to join, and our lessons will teach everything you need to know. Traditionally, in the first 5 months, we will have training/off-season where club members will learn how to code and will practice applying it to small projects that reinforce their skills. Meetings will be held in discord, with separate voice channels for each of the fields we will teach. Our teaching will be more interactive and allow our members to critically think and be creative, rather than make them memorize syntax. If a new member comes during the training season, they will be able to catch up by looking at the resources we post on our Discord for each lesson. Questions about the material will be designated to another Discord channel, where the Presidents and the Instructional department can help. After the training season, we will have a build season where we vote on projects for the three main fields of coding we will be teaching. Here, we will host open-source GitHub repositories where club members can contribute to the projects, which will be completed by the end of the school year. ","In the Open Source Studio, we will not only foster a fun coding environment but also a close community where people can work and learn about a certain field of coding alongside one another.

Our club also plans to create a community with a greater purpose of eventually publishing various open-source projects. Stuy students will work in a team-based environment, which prepares students for the rapidly changing and collaborative job market that our members will have a taste of in this club. A team-based environment is also highly emphasized so no one feels left behind or not smart enough to share ideas and help.

Going into specifics, our training projects will be hosted on GitHub classroom, where we will give students repositories on which they can complete mini projects. These mini projects will test the skills we teach our members every 2 weeks during the training season. Afterwards, our main project will be based on a schedule, including time for design/story decisions and deadlines for certain components/levels of each project.

Stuyvesant Relic,relic,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/relic/6320bdf0,Stuyvesant Relic aims to promote the field of anthropology to its members.,"Stuyvesant Relic is catered to students interested in anthropology or its tangential fields. General members are not expected to have exposure to the field - we just request an eagerness and commitment to learning. General members should aim to attend club activities at least 4 times a month. We will provide educational opportunities to explore the breadth of anthropology: this could range from general discussion panels to nuanced literature reviews. Members will also have the opportunity to learn essential wet and dry lab techniques and procedures from experienced mentors in accredited testing laboratories. Members taking the Forensic Science, Anthropology, or Regeneron electives stand to benefit in-class, as our discussions will likely overlap with those course materials. We require all members to be courteous of other members’ experiences and interests, as we are a supportive and academic community. Ultimately, we aim for all members to gain a newly-found appreciation for the social sciences.
","Stuyvesant Relic benefits the Stuyvesant community by providing academic and discussion opportunities to students interested in a niche social science. Still, students of all academic backgrounds will stand to benefit through the interdisciplinary study of anthropology - an analytical perspective on humanity is insightful and oftentimes underrated. Our pedagogy is hands-on and inquiry-oriented: we conduct experiments (adhering to the OSHA and school laboratory standards) and host discussion-based readings of relevant literature. We build foundational knowledge in this manner. We visit relevant exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum or the American Museum of Natural History to corroborate our studies and for enjoyment. We also host panel discussions with invited scientists where students are able to directly ask questions. Students also stand to benefit in various Stuyvesant classes (especially the electives mentioned in the Activity Purpose), as many disciplines will be explored. Students also have the opportunity to gain relevant research exposure in accredited testing laboratories and develop their technical writing skills throughout the process. Club activities will be funded in full - we don’t want potential financial limitations to impose on learning. Lastly, we are a tight-knit community of people who have a shared niche interest. We bond over our curiosity and appeal to anthropology and are all eager to better ourselves intellectually.",,"The executive cabinet will appoint leadership through an application process. This will consist of a written application and an interview. The written application will be a google form and will consist of questions relevant to the applicant’s ability and willingness to commit time to the club. For example, we would include questions about the applicant’s current time commitments, why they are interested in the club in general, and why they think they would be a good fit for the role. The written application will be viewed by all current cabinet members and if deemed adequate, an interview for those applicants would be scheduled. The interview would involve the current board and would be centered on getting to know the applicant better as a person, as opposed to just their accomplishments on paper. Questions would be asked with the purpose of gaining a better and more holistic view of the applicant, as well as to accurately gauge their commitment. If a board member demonstrates disorderly conduct, they will receive a strike (three strikes will lead to an impeachment trial). In the case of an impeachment trial, the remaining board members will meet to discuss the position of the board member in question. A vote will then be held on whether that board member’s position will be revoked or kept. An important part of this process is that all current cabinet members take part and agree on final decisions, as we understand the importance of unanimity when considering the future of this club.

","Stuyvesant Relic provides a unique opportunity for students to explore the field of anthropology. Anthropology delves into evolutionary biology, psychology, human behavior, culture, and linguistics all at once: it is an inherently social form of science. It is the crossroad between humanities and science and requires a multitude of skill sets, which we will introduce to our club members. Anthropology can expose students to different disciplines, including other social sciences and behavior studies, or humanities, such as philosophy or theology, which isn’t a very common focus at Stuyvesant.

""","It's important to maintain a connection with Mother Countries that our blood comes from. Otherwise, the beautiful language and culture of that country perish into the winds of time, with no heirs to the rich fulfillment that comes with knowing where YOU come from, rather a frank nothingness. Either people too dead to care about their roots, or too dull to make an effort to remember. In my experience with my Slovak and Czech family friends, it's quite sad to see how to all neutral spectators of their lives, the ""Slovak"", or ""Czech"" (from this point forth when I refer to anything ""Slovak"" or ""Czech"" I will combine them in the term ""Czechoslovak"") in them dies with their kids. Their kids don't know the Czechoslovak language, don't know the culture, don't know where they come from or how it affects them today, and worst of all, they can't communicate with their family from our two countries. That's the saddest part, the inability to connect to the place that in a sense, birthed you. That is why it is important for us Czechs and Slovaks to stick together. It is necessary for us younger generations to take it upon ourselves to make sure that our children, their children, and the children after that KNOW where they come from. It is easy to forget where your roots are, especially when you come from such relatively small countries such as our which constantly get mistaken from Russia. That's why it's important and beneficial to join this club, find some friends, learn about our cultures and make sure it survives to the nect generation. ",,"The way that the leadership position at this club will be rotated is that once the acting leader graduates, or for any reason needs to give up their position will be that the leader will choose the longest-serving member since becoming leader, or the member which displays the greatest amount of dedication and commitment to the club(which may or may not also be the longest-serving member). Just in general at this club members will be expected to come to meetings whenever they can, have some interesting conversations with each other, try to be friendly and ""social"", whatever that means to you, and expected to abide by our central dogma, trying to learn and connect about our cultures and languages in order to build a strong community here at Stuy, which hopefully can survive outside of the school, and perhaps connect with other Slovak/Czech groups in the outside world. That's all. ","There's no club like this club. Czechs and Slovaks are not large nations, they do not have large amounts of people. That is why outside of our home nations, in places like New York City, you feel an unbelieavble sense of pride and ""home"" when you meet a person who is Czech and Slovak. Our cultures are just so different from that of the United States, so it feels very comforting to connect with people from where we are from. You feel like you're not alone. I think this is more true than many other people can claim, like those from the US, Russia, China etc. That is because they have such large populations, but us, we're small. We need to stick by each other and help each other out.

Balkan Appreciation Club,bac,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/bac/6196d856,"The BAC is all about spreading the culture and history of the Balkans and forming connections between Balkan and other cultures at Stuy.

","This is a low-commitment club where members will be expected to attend the meetings and will be expected to interact with other members of the club in order to form cultural connections and deepen their understanding of Balkan culture and history. General members are also welcome to create their own lessons on any information they know about the Balkans and present it to the club. Balkan members and general members are also welcome to share their culture, history and traditions since the BAC wants to bridge connections between Balkan culture and the other heritages present at the school. The meetings will typically be online meetings and will held on Fridays every month or so. However, some meetings, such as those before breaks, can be in person and will be treated as a culture party where all are welcome to share stories, food, and traditions with the other members in the club.
","The club will benefit the Stuyvesant community by informing people about the forgotten history and culture of the Balkans. It will allow many of the Balkan students at Stuy to participate in their culture and connect with other students who share similar cultures. The BAC will also be open to those who are not Balkan but are interested in learning about their classmates’ backgrounds and heritage. It will form a new community within the school that will let students connect back to their roots, which aren’t as mainstream in NYC and in Stuyvesant. Many Balkan students come from immigrant backgrounds that aren’t as heavily represented as other European cultures. Balkan history isn’t given the attention it deserves in the New York City global curriculum or the AP European History curriculum. The BAC will serve to fill in that gap. Through exploring Balkan foods, celebrations, and history, members of the BAC will be able to learn more about the culture of their fellow members. Not only will this club provide opportunities for students to develop their knowledge of regions around the world, but it will also be an opportunity for them to expand their social life and make new friends here.",,"What are the leadership positions and how are they appointed? What is the policy for transfer of leadership between school years?
The leadership positions are two basic leaders who come up and make the official meetings and their plans. There is also a marketing/social media management department. Members who wish to join this department can submit an application at the beginning of each semester and will be chosen by the club leaders. Leadership positions are appointed by having those who wish to run state why and what they would do if they were appointed. Interviews will then be hosted to decide who is the best choice. This process will also be done for transferring leadership in addition to a meeting to officially induct them as leaders. 

Are there any specific protocols members are expected to follow? How will leaders be removed if necessary?
Members are expected to attend the meetings regularly and are expected to be respectful to one another and failure to do so will harm chances of having a leadership position and may even be forced to leave the club. Leaders are also held up to this standard and must uphold the responsibilities of their job; if a leader is disrespectful or isn't upholding the responsibilities of their job, a meeting will be held to discuss their actions and if needed will be forced to step down from their position and replaced with someone new. Depending on the reason of their removal, the previous leader can still remain a member of the club but have their responsibilities and role revoked or be kicked out.","The BAC is a unique organization because it not only can create connections between different cultures at Stuy but it shines a light on the Balkan countries which have been ignored in history and curriculums for many years. This club will talk about untaught history of the Balkans, their impact in world history, the culture, traditions, and more. Unlike most clubs where only the leaders come up with plans for the clubs, the club also open up the floor for the members to teach us and tell us what else they would like to see.",Meeting schedules vary but they will be about once a month and typically on Fridays.,['friday'],low,"['balkan', 'culture', 'diversity']",,"Amy Gorreja - Creator/ President

SMERC provides opportunities for students to learn about biology and medicine in an hands-on, direct way. For example, during future meetings, we will have guest speakers who are in the field of medicine explain their career path, as well as the pros and cons of embarking on a journey into the field of medicine. This will be a great opportunity for students who are thinking of going into the field of medicine, as it will allow them to see what their real life potential job may be. Volunteer work will give students the chance to help others in need, something which is the essence of medicine. Additionally, this club will have opportunities for learning emergency response tactics such as CPR, how to use a defibrillator, etc. This will give students to learn real, hands-on methods for saving others, and will give them insight on what it means to be in the field of medicine. Furthermore, SMERC will have group tutoring for biology courses, such as AP Biology. This will help students prepare for their exams. ","SMERC will allow students to explore the field of medicine in a stress free, hands on way, deciding which activities are most important to them and devoting their time into that. It is a great club for people who are unsure of what career path they want to embark on. For example, hearing from guest speakers will allow students to gain valuable insight on what it means to be in medicine and what the jobs in medicine are actually like. This will help people decide if they wish to go into medicine or not. In addition, tutoring service will help students work through difficult coursework, and will help prepare them for exams such as the APs. Volunteering both in school and out of school will bring a positive impact to the community, and will allow students to obtain volunteer hours. Emergency response training, such as CPR training and lifeguard training, will show students the essence of medicine: helping others in need. Students will not be required to attend every meeting, and would only go to the meetings which are of interest to them. This allows each member of SMERC to be fully involved & invested in whichever area of medicine they are interested in or want to explore. This also makes the club a more enjoyable experience. SMERC will help students delve deeper into the field of medicine with volunteering opportunities, emergency response training, guest speakers, and tutoring.

All lovers of tea, coffee, water, boba, and other beverages are welcome.","StuySips is a low-commitment club dedicated to creating a wholesome environment where all Stuyvesant students can talk, learn, and share all about drinks. This club intends to bring people together, especially after current events where students may be reluctant to connect with others, and all the while spreading knowledge of the significance behind drinks. Meeting structures will be determined by member interest and meetings are not mandatory but members are highly encouraged to attend. These meetings can range from introducing members to different types of drinks, the traditional ways of preparing drinks, and the history behind drinks to ""off days"" where we simply de-stress and share about our days. In general, members will gather a few times a month to unwind after tests/projects, accompanied by free food and drinks provided by club leaders, and potentially create their own drinks as well. If members have anything specific they want to be brought into a meeting, they can request it from club leaders or bring in their own food/drinks. We will also send out optional surveys after every meeting for feedback and suggestions on meetings. We also plan on having potential fundraisers for important causes by selling drinks if our schedule permits. Our main goal is to allow members to relax through the sharing and creating of drinks.","Historically, drinking tea and other beverages has been shown to provide many benefits. This can be improving mental health, reducing feelings of anxiety and stress, allowing people to relate with each other, and much more. In fact, another one of the benefits conferred is that drinking black tea everything decreases your chance of getting a heart attack by 44%. In an environment like Stuyvesant, relaxing after stressful assignments like tests and projects can prevent burnout and long-term stress, especially since most people never take the time to wind down. While most of the Stuyvesant population frequently uses coffee loaded with sugary products as a caffeine booster, too much usage of coffee can build dependency and cause other problems. We plan on spreading awareness and providing alternative, healthier drinks with similar effects to coffee without such adverse effects. Our meetings will be unrigid and allow students to hang out with their friends and/or do assignments with an add-on of free snacks, academic learning about beverages, and the opportunities to make their own drinks like in real cafes. To conclude, this activity will benefit the student population throughout the school year through the provision of healthy drinks, a place to relax, and much more.

swifties at stuy,swiftiesatstuy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/swiftiesatstuy/4a190e23,Swifties at Stuy is a club that's meant for both die-hard Taylor Swift fans and people who just enjoy her music. ,"Swifties at Stuy is meant to be a commonplace for those who love Taylor Swift, not only as a musician but also as a person. At meetings, members will have listening parties for new albums, get regular updates from Taylor's social media, watch her documentaries, and analyze her lyrics in depth. Members will also become familiar with the various 'love triangles' present in her music and other fan theories. Members will be expected to come to every single meeting as the club will only be meeting once every two weeks. If members have another time commitment taking up the time slot, then they will be expected to fill out the absence form with their valid excuse. If members miss more than three meetings unexcused they will be removed from the club. If any member is seen as being disruptive or is an 'anti-Swiftie,' they will not be welcome in the meetings and will be escorted out.

","Swifties at Stuy will benefit the Stuyvesant community as it will serve as a great bonding experience for the large number of Swifties at Stuy. Swifties at Stuy provides a safe space and/or haven for those to share their experience as a Swiftie and gives others the chance to grow as a fan. Continuing on, Swifties at Stuy also allows beginner and/or intermediate fans to get in touch with experienced fans and gives incentives for new budding friendships to form. Club members do not need to worry about who to go with to concerts as Swifties at Stuy is a small community in itself that eliminates these worries. Additionally, it is the perfect place to figure out your interests and get to know yourself better. Some individuals prefer to be a fan that strictly only listens to the artist's music while others prefer to get to know the artist and figure out the background behind the music they're listening to. To continue, a lot of the meetings will be focused on analyzing Swift's lyrics on a deeper level, which will definitely help with the analysis members will be doing in their English and History classes, but this time it's about something they enjoy!
",https://www.instagram.com/swiftiesatstuy/,"Club leaders will be appointed with a short questionnaire via a Google Form. After a careful, unbiased review and discussion by current leaders will they proceed to a short interview, where leaders will be chosen. If leaders are unhelpful and do not contribute to meeting agendas or in general, they will be removed from their positions. Furthermore, if they deign to show up at meetings between leaders, they will be removed. Leaders are also expected to be respectful and courteous to everybody, regardless of personal issues, and if they fail to do so they will be removed. Once the current leaders have graduated, they will come together to appoint new leaders for the next year. Leaders should be active in group chats and should communicate well with the other leaders. If a leader wishes to forgo their position, then they must tell the other leaders at least a month in advance.
","Our organization is unique as it is the only club at Stuy that focuses on a certain artist and their music. Despite the fact that it seems difficult to organize a club based on a single artist and only them, Taylor Swift is one of the most versatile artists that has been around for a decade. Much of Stuyvesant has grown up with her, and I am sure many would find genuine enjoyment in being a part of a community that discusses Taylor Swift and only Taylor swift. With over 200 songs out, and appearances in over 59 music videos, television shows, and movies, she is the perfect candidate to be the center of discussion.

Whether you write as a hobby or aim to pursue writing as a career, this club is perfect for you. No matter how creative you are, this club will help you enhance your plotlines to their utmost capabilities. Even if you wish to try out other types of writing—including, but not limited to: screenwriting, poetry, and narratives. They will teach you the basics to structuring and anything else to note. In addition to that, if you have any writing pieces that you have already already written, but you still want to get feedback, the club members and leadership board will be happy to help. Members are encouraged to engage in peer editing and collaborations, if they wish. They also cater to different unconventional types of writing including both manga and comics. The club offers a great way to make connections with people that share similar interests. A lot of the work will happen asynchronously since everyone does things at different paces. 
","This club brings together writers of all levels and creates a group of people who share similar interests that they can talk to and interact with. We strive to create a community within Stuyvesant that encourages writers to keep writing and gives them means to do so. Members can share their personal experiences and/or expertise and get help and advice from other members. We hope to make writing less scary and ease the imposter syndrome that can come from attending a STEM-focused school. We will have editing opportunities, chances to share pieces of writing, and discussions about whatever problems writers may face (world-building, the publishing process, writer’s block, etc.). In time, we hope Writer’s United will bring together an eager group of writers at Stuy who can work together and learn from each other. This is a less strict and formal writing extracurricular, contrary to the Stuyvesant Spectator or the Caliper that operate in a very fast-paced manner that is focused on publication. Because of this, Writer’s United would be more catered to the writer themselves and answering their questions, concerns or thoughts about writing. In addition to that, this club also aims to enhance its members’ creative thinking skills. We understand that with everything going around in the world right now, some people might want to escape reality, and writing is a perfect way to do that. 
",,"Before the club was started, the creator posted an application for the first round of leadership roles. The application asked basic questions about the applicant's background in writing, previous leadership experiences, etc. After reading through all the applications, she picked the ones that she felt would be the most capable at running the club. More applications for future leadership positions will come out after the club officially begins, and the current leadership board (including the presidents and vice president) will look over the applications together and pick the ones they feel will be better suited for the task. If someone with a leadership position is not fulfilling their role properly, the rest of the leadership board will come together and vote on whether they should issue a stern warning or take the leadership role from that person all together. When the current leaders are seniors, an application will be released for leaders in trainings, and after the current leaders graduate, those leaders in training will become the new leadership cabinet.
","Here in Stuyvesant, there is a lack of focus on creative writing, even in extracurriculars, and it’s difficult to find a group of passionate writers. Writers United aims to provide a community of writers where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas, experiences, and expertise. Stuyvesant is a science and math based school, but everyone can find an escape in writing. This club also aims to express creativity through exploring multiple different kinds of writing, so we do not conform to one particular style of writing.
","Writers United plans to meet one day per week, maybe two depending on member interest. We plan to operate each meeting for 1-2 hours and want to hold mainly in person meetings. Though if we are faced with conflicting schedules, we might hold a few virtual meetings.

While Stuyvesant has a myriad of different sports clubs and teams, our goal is to introduce the often overlooked winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding and ice skating, and to make them accessible to students. We understand that there is much hassle in the accessibility of ski mountains and equipment rental, so we would like to make the experience as easy as possible so that everyone can enjoy the outdoors. 

Each year, we are planning to execute 2 trips a year, one to a nearby ski mountain and one to an ice skating rink for any Stuyvesant student interested in getting into the outdoors. Members will assist leaders in contacting mountains for student discounts, organizing fundraisers, as well as coordinating transportation to the locations. Beyond that, we’d just like to create a fun outdoor environment where friendships can be forged over a shared love of snow, outdoors and fun!","This activity will benefit Stuyvesant by reducing stress, allowing time in the outdoors and creating a setting where students can enjoy themselves without worry or care. Having a mountain to escape to, even if just for a day, will strengthen and create bonds between friends without the pressure or stress of our everyday school environments. 

Stuyvesant has many clubs dedicated to the introduction of sports but none of which are devoted to winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and ice skating. Within our busy everyday lives, we understand that it is difficult to arrange a trip to the mountains, and would like to make the travel and rental experience as smooth as possible so that students can have a fun day off with friends. 

In addition, students will be able to develop their communication and leadership skills by reaching out to various mountains and organizations. The process invokes several organizational skills that will be useful for planning events and trips in the future, and helping us fundraise would allow interaction with the rest of the Stuyvesant community. The opportunity to expand the chance for students to get away for a long weekend would not only foster new friendships, but an undiscovered love for winter sports as well. ","Email: stuywintersports@gmail.com, Instagram: stuywintersportsclub","The Winter Sports Club is led by two co-presidents, a vice president, treasurer and a social media manager who work alongside the members to organize events and conduct outreach to various mountains and ice skating rinks, as well as the Stuyvesant community. 

Co-presidents are expected to fulfill their duties by leading meetings each month and calling mountains and rinks. Should a co-president be unable to step in every so often, the vice president will help take over their responsibilities temporarily. If a leader fails to complete their duties over a period of time, members and/or their fellow leaders may express their concerns in an anonymous Google Form submission. Three such submissions will warrant the voting of impeachment through another anonymous Google Form, and if 75% are in agreement to impeach, a leader will be removed from their position.

A leader may remain in their position for multiple years if they wish to. If one or several leaders decide to step down, interested members will have the opportunity to submit anonymous applications, which the current leaders will review. The new leader(s) must be approved by at least two of the current leaders.","The Winter Sports Club is unique because it allows for new connections and a developed love of the outdoors through sports typically overlooked. Twice a year, it will provide club members and non-club members alike an opportunity to enjoy a fun outing with their friends while learning a new sport. Through the planning and organization of these trips, members will learn life skills of communication, leadership and networking in a stress-less environment in a relaxed manner that culminates in an enjoyable holiday out on the mountain.","Two or three times a month, depending on what needs to be arranged based on prior communication between club members.",['friday'],low,"['skiing', 'snowboarding', 'skating']",,"Sophianne Leung - Creator

","The Stuyvesant Être Girls is a chapter of a non-profit organization working to mentor girls. The goal is to help inspire and allow students to explore fields of interest to help them determine what they want to do in the future. This club holds multiple meetings a month where a specific field will be highlighted, with the aim that students can learn about that field in depth. Successful women in their field will also be featured in those meetings as occasional speakers, with field trips to the offices of major companies happening every once in a while. Members in the club have the opportunity to go into companies of their choice and meet female leaders to learn about what they do in a day at their job. Nothing is mandatory but attending at least one meeting a month is suggested to help get as much out of the club as possible.
","This activity is beneficial to the Stuyvesant community as it creates a supportive environment where girls can discover who they are and what they want to be. Especially at Stuyvesant, many students feel the pressure of needing to know what they want to be before college, and while that isn't necessary, it can be very helpful for high schoolers to start exploring possible career paths early. By providing students with the chance to explore numerous fields in depth, they can learn more about fields that they were previously interested in, or find completely new interests. This club gives students those opportunities through specialized meetings, speaker events, and trips, in hopes that they will find a career path they want to pursue with a group of people who have the same goal. While there will be outside mentors, this can also be a place where students at Stuy can help each other, whether it is introducing each other to new interests, or helping pick classes at Stuy that relate to one’s interests. Upperclassmen can expand on their own interests by seeing them in a real-life setting, or they could find new fields that they hadn’t thought of before. Upperclassmen hopefully can also help support the underclassmen in their interests, and in classes that reflect those interests as they will have more experience.

Lower Council would consist of Events Committee members and outreach committee members. Leadership positions will be appointed based on an application and interview process annually. Applications will be anonymous and reviewed by the current President and Vice President. Anyone who was part of the club that year would be allowed to apply for the next academic school year. Leadership will be transferred every year and current leaders would have to reapply. If there is an event where a member reports to the President and Vice President about a leader who isn’t fulfilling their duties, the leader will have a meeting with the Upper Council as a first warning. If duties are not fulfilled a second time, there will be a meeting among the Upper Council and a vote will be held for the leader in question. If the majority votes for the leader to step down from their position, they will be stripped of their leadership role in the club. There will be an emergency vote among the Upper Council to elect a new leader in their position. 

","Our organization is unique because of the variety of speakers there will be and its association with the Etre Girls non profit organization. Members will be participating in events from many different fields and will have a chance to intern under the Etre Girls Organization. Not only will they learn about these different fields, but can also experience hands on what different careers are like. This hands on experience is a valuable tool for everyone in the club.

The two co-presidents, currently the creators of the club, must have a strong foundation, in regards to cultural and linguistic knowledge as well as general awareness. Leaders will work with club members to plan and hold events and will take charge of keeping up to date with all meetings and other administrative issues. They will lead meetings, in the form of presentations and discussions, keep other members informed of their tasks and duties, and will make the final decisions. The vice presidents will be elected by application processes and based on the amount of time and effort the members dedicated to the club. In instances where the president(s) are unable to attend meetings, they will be responsible for making sure meetings run smoothly. Although tentative, the Social Media Manager will work to promote events and meetings that the club will hold on various platforms to secure attendance. There will be leadership rotations every semester and impeachment if members agree that a leader is not carrying out their responsibilities.
","Students of the Himalayan region are a minority among minorities. At Stuy, there are only a handful of Tibetans and other ethnicities from the Himalayas; the SHCC strives to strengthen the Himalayan community through volunteer work and discussion. Many Tibetan students are unaware that there are other Tibetans at Stuy as a result of the large student body, and likewise for the other regional groups. This club allows for a connection between club members who will be able to have a dedicated community of people who can help them and others not forget their identity and culture.

No meetings are mandatory, but it is highly encouraged to attend all of them because every meeting is unique in its own way. Presidents plan a different activity for each meeting, which is meant to expose members to their own culture or introduce them to new Eastern European cultures. Past activities have included drinking kompot together, playing Kahoots, speaking in native languages, and watching cultural films. Additionally, members are encouraged (but not mandated) to bring different ethnic foods from their culture to share with everyone. Thus, in addition to partaking in the main activities of the meeting, members can talk and eat.

This is because members have the chance to meet other people in Stuy who share their same cultural heritage, and bond over shared family and life experiences. Club time is a safe space where everyone is encouraged to speak their native language and/or learn some basic phrases from other people's languages. Members will learn more about where they come from, which will help develop their identity. Additionally, some meetings are designated for learning about the history of the Soviet Union and all the nations that came from it. This is useful to people of all cultures in Stuyvesant. Due to this, non-Eastern European speakers are also welcome to join to learn more about Eastern European culture.

Minimum time joined to be considered for leadership will be two months. We also ask for leaders to not only be active inside the club but outside of school and in our socials. 

If a leader has been breaching club rules by being absent for multiple meetings, unengaging, unkind, and insensible for a multitude of months, then we will unfortunately be forced to impeach them from their leadership position. A new member will be looked into and promoted to the vacant seat. If a leader resigns, then a similar procedure will follow.

Growing up in New York, I always noticed how immigrant populations tended to group together, forming neighborhoods like Chinatown or Little Italy. I also always noticed how there was no Japan-town or ethnic pocket for Japanese people to rely on. Without a strong community, or friends and peers who are from the same place as you, kids can lose touch with their ethnic identity and feel disconnected. The JSA would function as a space where students can actualize their ethnicity, engage and take pride in their Japanese-ness, and bond with students they have commonalities with - students that they may not have met otherwise. Because of the massive nature of Stuy, and the relatively small Japanese student body, this club has the opportunity to introduce students across grades and disciplines for the first time.","At the moment, Japanese students at Stuyvesant are disconnected from each other. The JSA would help connect students with common heritage and help them create bonds to last a lifetime. In laying a strong foundation, we have the opportunity to create a support system and tight-knit community for current Japanese students and the students to come. Additionally, the JSA serves as a way to get in touch with your heritage. In meetings, we plan to conduct traditional cultural activities, such as tea ceremonies or Girls' Day, or engage in discussions about shared experiences and things that pertain to the Japanese community. This would help Japanese students stay in touch with their culture in ways they may not have been able to otherwise. We will explore Japanese film, music, and art, as well as food, holidays, fashion, and current events, and help Japanese-American kids stay in touch with current events in Japan. Finally, we aim to speak in Japanese for the majority of meetings in order to practice and strengthen our language skills. For kids that are more confident in Japanese than English, this will be a space where they can be comfortable and speak their preferred language to kids their age.

",@stuyjsa on Instagram,"The President will lead most of the procedures in the JSA. In addition to this, there are positions open for directors of Outreach and Fundraising. These will be appointed by the co-founders, and they will be chosen based on commitment, enthusiasm, and organization. Being a Director of Outreach entails reaching out to external Japanese organizations, which can range from cultural centers to corporations, and facilitating events for cultural appreciation and discussion. Being a Director of Fundraising entails setting up opportunities to raise money for club activities, or getting in touch with potential sponsors, as well as managing the finances of the club and delegating funds for certain ventures. The positions are subject to change and more leadership may be added. A new president is voted on every new school year, at the second meeting, and those with the right to vote are active members of the JSA (attended first and second meeting). In order to impeach a president, the active members of the club must reach a 2/3 vote. ","At the moment, there is no club that provides a space specifically for Japanese students. Although Japan is within the Asian diaspora, the experience of Japanese-Americans is often very different than that of people of other Asian ethnicities. This club is unique in that it is made for Japanese students by Japanese students, and focuses on preserving Japanese culture and traditions. This club also differs from the Japanese media club because it focuses on other parts of the culture and aims to de-emphasize anime from the larger perception of Japan.

","Roblox is a unique platform where people of a variety of interests in gaming can come together.

In SBC, we also aim to introduce and connect those in the lesser-known fields of interest that Roblox provides. While Roblox has already built a strong community of game players, Roblox has also built a smaller but not less prominent community of students interested in coding, game development, 3d modeling, and even clothing design. Roblox Studio, A branch of Roblox, provides anyone with the knowledge in coding languages such a C++ and Lua to publish their games. We hope to maximize productivity of such games by gathering those in this specific field of interest. Members that are not specifically interested in the game development side of SBC can interact with the club during activities on Roblox, including events or competitions. However, they will be expected to share their Username for activities we might have in Roblox. This allows anonymity for those who struggle to let themselves out there in the face of teamwork and socialization.

It gives students opportunities to connect without the typical social pressure present in typical interactions in the Stuyvesant’s competitive nature may create.

The math team is also one of the only clubs with teachers who direct each club activity, giving students insight and providing an experience for a better problem-solving experience. Not only do these students build connections with each other, they can also create connections with other students beyond the city, state, and even, the nation. ",https://mathteam.stuy.edu/,"Mr. Sterr or Mr. Kats selects the senior captains for the math team each year. Additionally, applications are sent out by email for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors to apply for assistant captains for each grade. Captains write problems and organize the Wednesday practices, which are for all grades to practice for the AMCs and AIME, and Friday practices, which are for Juniors and Seniors. Junior assistant captains write and organize the Tuesday practices, which are for Freshmen and Sophomores. Senior and sophomore assistant captains help out with these practices. If a captain or assistant captain is not doing their necessary role, Mr. Sterr or Mr. Kats will remove this person from their position and assign it to another student of the same grade. Not attending practices or actively listening in class may also result in someone getting cut from Math Team. However, these occurrences happen rarely and should not discourage anyone from applying.","We are the only math team that has ever existed in Stuyvesant and have a very long history in this school.

StuyNeuro,stuyneuro,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyneuro/d215078a,We aim to expose the youth to the field of neuroscience and inspire students to pursue this area of study and explore careers in it.,"Club meetings consist of several different activities. Activities range from labs to seminars to open teaching-learning sessions allowing students to benefit from a well-rounded neuroscience course. The club will normally have meetings once a week, a maximum twice a week, during which students will learn about different aspects of the brain through student-generated presentations using college level material and beyond. We will also try to incorporate infrequent projects that are not entirely time-consuming but are engaging and interesting for the student to take part in, and the people they are presenting to learn about. We will also try to bring professors and students in the field to Stuyvesant in order to give lectures or do lessons on the subject. Members are expected to attend meetings on a consistent basis with only excused absences. If members are expected to present work or bring in material, they must coordinate with leaders and conduct their work accordingly. ","StuyNeuro is a chapter of the International Youth Neuroscience Association, an organization dedicated to helping students discover their passions for neuroscience. The organization provides mentors for those who want advice for navigating high school in a neuroscience-oriented manner. Our club will focus on teaching students about neuroscience topics, careers, and opportunities. We think it important that the Stuyvesant community benefit from the vast amount of career options an education in neuroscience can provide. If you are genuinely interested in a career in neuroscience, it is important to build connections as well, and our multitude of professional lectures can help you make those connections with world renowned surgeons, college professors, and even researchers. We also teach how to ignite a spark between you and the person with whom you are trying to work, or study under, since most of us have had that experience ourselves. It is also important to establish a base knowledge in neuroscience, because it can help to know about the subject if you are wanting to pursue any medically-oriented career. There is also currently a lot that scientists don't know about the human brain, and coming up with theories and doing research can be beneficial for your critical thinking skills, and your overall educational career, no matter what field you are studying.",@stuynuero,"As of now, leadership positions have simply been passed down from seniors to juniors and sophomores, but as the club grows and continues, we are planning to have leadership positions be appointed to people the current president and vice-president feel deserve it. This is someone with consistent attendance and someone who doesn't hesitate to ask questions, or do research on their own. As the president or vice president, you must be a leader. You have to be able to do research for presentation topics, and know how to present them as seamlessly as possible. Other positions, such as treasurer, will be appointed by the people who currently hold that position and reviewed by the president, to ensure a perfect fit. You must be passionate about the club, and willing to do everything that it takes to run it. For transfer of leadership positions, if there are underclassmen currently holding them, they will keep their position unless they are deemed unfit to do so, or they will be given a higher position than they currently hold. The ""impeachment"" process is quite simple. Each leader must come to every event, unless there is a dire circumstance in which they are unable to make it. If a leader continuously bails on meetings and/or does not complete requirements on time, they will be removed from their position and will be replaced. Due to Covid, the club and leadership choices did not run too smoothly last year so they were unable to appoint a treasurer and any other position. We hope to appoint a member to this position some time within the next couple of weeks.","Among the many STEM courses at Stuyvesant, StuyNeuro is the only one that offers an in depth look into the science and autonomy of the brain. We also work to connect students to opportunities in the medical field, and work together with other club to expose our members to the world of scientific studies that you can connect neuroscience to. Our club has many different options when it comes to topics we go through, and labs we cover. It's a thorough look into one of science's biggest mysteries.","Meetings are hosted every Monday, unless otherwise announced.

Stuyvesant Women in Physics and Engineering,SWPE,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/SWPE/390a53f1,We hope to support women in the field of physics at Stuyvesant.,"This club’s purpose is to help equalize the disparities between women and men in the physics field so they can work in unison as partners. According to data from the American Institute of Physics, only 20% of physics PhDs are women –– there are more women in other STEM fields. Some challenges facing women currently include the lack of equipment, technical support, travel money, funding, clerical support, and employees/students; barriers women cited included gender bias, issues with mentors, and lack of networks. We hope to bring together female students interested in physics and engineering, so they can have meaningful networks, understand the history and future, and be exposed to current women in the Physics field. In addition to inviting lecturers from the different fields of physics and engineering, pursuing field trips and being part of events, we hope to create experiments, read books and watch movies about successful women in physics, learn about different opportunities, and see how we can contribute to making the workforce more represented.","This club will provide a unique environment for both females and males who are interested in physics to further explore the subject area beyond the academic curriculum provided at Stuyvesant. Through this club, we will provide enriching opportunities that allow members to dive further into physics by learning about specific fields in physics (e.g. astronomy) from experts , perform hands-on activities, and discuss new ideas with other interested individuals. Our events and activities can also be a great way to further cement the understanding of the topics taught in Stuy physics courses. In addition to being a place where one can connect with others with similar interests, this club will also serve as a friendly environment for people to form new friendships. This is especially important due to the large size of our school, which can sometimes make it difficult for people to find their place at school. Additionally, as many students are beginning to search for a potential career path, Women in Physics can expose interested students to more valuable and unique opportunities (such as networking with adults and experienced people in the workforce) in the realm of physics, which can contribute to our student's future academic plans and careers.",Instagram: StuyWomenInPhysics and Facebook Group: Women in Physics and Engineering,"""Members are expected to attend most meetings and are allowed 3 unexcused meeting absences. Once they reach this limit, they will no longer be able to participate in the club. 

There will be four available leadership positions: President, Vice President, Activity Manager, and an Outreach Specialist. For each leadership position, appointments will be made through evaluation of the member’s dedication to the club and an application form with questions tailored to each position. 
Leaders may be impeached if they are frequently absent from meetings without notice or continuously act rudely or disrespectfully towards club members or fellow leaders. If a leader’s actions fall into the former, the other leaders will reach out to said leader to see if a resolution can be made. If the situation is irreparable, or the leader’s actions fall into the latter category, a collective vote with all the club members will take place to decide whether or not the leader should be removed from their position. If the majority vote to remove the leader, said leader will step down from their position and can remain in the club as a participant. New applications for that specific leadership position will be sent out to normal members in order to appoint a replacement for that position.""","This organization is unique because we are working to help women fight for equality in an underrepresented field at Stuyvesant through clubs. We hope to bring power to anyone who wants to make this issue well-known and to work on making it so everyone can pursue their dreams. In addition to lectures and field trips (if possible with Covid-19 guidelines), we hope to bring in experiments, documentaries, and possible opportunities –– empowering women around us for a more represented workplace.","We plan to meet 2-4 times a month, stemming from different lectures to watching movies.",['wednesday'],medium,"['science', 'engineering', 'physics']",,"Nafisa Hoque - Co-president

","The Stuyvesant Board of Elections is in charge of making sure that all of the Caucus and Student Union elections run smoothly. The BOE is responsible for scheduling, organizing, and managing all student government elections at Stuy. There are five elections held a year: Freshman Caucus elections in the fall, and Student Union, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior elections in the spring. It is a low commitment activity, and it is a great way to become involved in the behind-the-scenes of Student Government without holding office.

The Stuyvesant BOE consists of two committees: The Voting Board and Debate Moderators. The Voting Board works closely with the campaign tickets, ensuring that they follow the Official rules outlined by the BOE every year, and that their campaign information online is up to date. The Debate Moderators organize the debates and compile questions for the candidate, as well as ensuring that the debates run smoothly and efficiently. ","The Stuyvesant Board of Elections ensures that every student government election runs smoothly and without any issues. Under the guidance of the Board of Elections, each and every campaign is assured that they will have a smooth running election, overseen without any bias and the assurance that every campaign will have the same opportunities and same information. It is essential to the wellbeing of the Stuyvesant Student body that each grade, as well as the school as a whole, is lead by dedicated and trustworthy students who strive to better the school, and who will represent the voice of the students. Every election and campaign is monitored closely by the members of the Board of Elections to uphold the quality of the leadership who the students will eventually elect into office.

Not only does the activity benefit the general student population of Stuyvesant, but the members learn essential skills in communication, management, and organization. They learn about the general processes that our Student Government goes through in order to make it into office. By working alongside the potential members of the student government, they Board of Elections members will feel more confident in our student government, understanding the level of work that candidates put in to getting elected.",@stuyboe,"Every election cycle, there are two Co-Chairs that oversee the entire election process. A new co chair is appointed before the spring elections, and will hold their position until the conclusion of the freshman caucus elections of their senior year, working as co-chair for a total of four election cycles. After the senior co-chair ""retires"" in the fall of their senior year, the junior co-chair will pick a sophomore member of the Board of Elections to become the next deputy co-chair based on their work as a general member the previous election cycles.

Members are chosen by the co-chairs before every spring election cycle. Members apply through a google form application, and may have to go through an interview process. Typically, three to four members are chosen for the debate moderation team, and ten to fifteen voting board members are appointed. Only current freshmen, sophomores, and juniors may apply when applications open; senior BOE members retire after the fall election cycle of their senior year alongside the senior chair.","The Student Union is unique because it is one of the most extensive and influential student government in New York City.

Dungeons and Dragons is a mechanically focused game, with abilities and the system directly being involved in roleplaying opportunities. However, the DnD system does not support personality growth and does not go in depth into a creator's characters. In this club, we encourage creative people to express a side of contemporary issues that they are concerned with through role-playing. Writers and people with great imagination alike can explore subject matters with each other, building (a) character(literally). For those uncomfortable with the topics, this club is also for people wanting light-hearted adventures about childhood, or becoming integrated into a foreign life . For those who are fans of fantasy, but not in a full magical setting, our club can also explore systems made for scientific fictions, culturally-inspired ""magic"" systems, villainy, and even simply the trope of teenagers getting superpowers. ","This club will introduce new interests to circulate amongst the Stuyvesant Community, create new common interests that can spark new friendships, and allow individuals to project their current thoughts of mind without judgment through role-playing. For writers, it expands creativity and allows them an audience to read their intricate stories while portraying their stories by how they interpret it. Adaptations of characters and inspiration encourages research within this community, which expands the skills of all within this club. Awareness will be raised on subjects in a fun way. We can distribute resources and that'll allow students to learn more about social issues in real life while serving entertainment and having a laugh. It's also a club for relaxation, for stressed students who may want to temporarily relax from the intense working environment of Stuyvesant and instead be immersed in fantasy. Generally, it just gives more options to people who enjoy RPG games but dislike only Dungeons and Dragons. Instead of complexity, this club will demonstrate simplicity with its systems, with ease to navigate, and most storylines will be by chance instead of modifiers. Moreover, older issues may resurface that we can discuss in detail, for those interested in the discussion of them. ",https://discord.gg/UexAXpaj9N,"For each session, we will be using safety tools, a common instrument used in role-playing games and board games alike to make sure everyone is comfortable with a certain subject matter. This will be required for each session. In addition, there are mandatory rules members need to follow on default. First, they should respect safety tools and do not make other members uncomfortable. Second, they should not abuse role-playing and use it as an excuse to perpetuate problematic moral beliefs and standards. Members should not mention any discriminatory beliefs that the members may have(e.g. homophobia, racism, misogyny, and other discriminations). Failure to comply to these simple, fundamental rules will result in the member being excluded from activities within this club. Leaders will organize club meetings and execute and teach the safety tools and ensure the comfortability of their members. Regarding transfer of leaderships, new leaders will be decided by previous leaders. There will be 3 leaders in this club to exercise fairness. Additionally, members who are not leaders can nominate a impeachment if they are reasonable, in which all members will discuss this request. Nominations will be anonymous in which the identity is unknown through anonymous requests online. ","While other clubs and organizations practice public speech, the Commentary TTRPG Settings is for quiet individuals who struggle in larger communities.

","Every meeting SEAA will have a specific theme and talk about Southeast Asian culture/experiences; for example, growing up Southeast Asian, colorism, different foods, representation, etc through slideshows and group discussions. SEAA will allow people to bring said foods and also allow people to bring in pieces of their culture (including traditional dances, clothing, etc) to promote these group discussions and create a safe space to talk about these topics. SEAA’s goal is to allow more people, both Southeast Asian and not, to learn more about cultures that are often less talked about and less appreciated compared to others. SEAA aims to discuss the history and traditions behind certain countries and give students a space to celebrate them in our school. SEAA will try to expose people to the media of Southeast Asia, such as shows and movies, through things like movie nights. SEAA will also find cultural festivals throughout the city and promote them to its club members. 
","Southeast Asian people are a minority in Stuyvesant, which can lead to people of those backgrounds feeling left out in the community. Even despite Stuyvesant’s majority Asian community, it can be easy to feel left out because most of that community is East Asian. When one is from a smaller country, it can be hard to find people of the same ethnicity as you, which can leave you feeling alone. Since Stuyvesant is such a big school, the Southeast Asian Alliance will make it easier to find those of a similar background. It is also reassuring to have a community that shares the same culture as you and be able to interact with them, even just casually. It is also a great way to get to learn more about other cultures, even if you are not Southeast Asian, since a lot of Southeast Asian culture gets overlooked. SEAA wants to make sure the Southeast Asian people in Stuyvesant feel seen and allow people to find and create new and meaningful friendships. SEAA also wants to promote cultural festivals in NYC to keep them running for years to come and foster a stronger connection to our cultures. Additionally, SEAA will try to find other cultural events around the city to volunteer and participate in. SEAA may try to host fundraisers to raise money for important issues in Southeast Asia, decided by vote for the year, as well. 
",instagram.com/stuyseaa,"There are currently two co-presidents in charge of all of our club activities. Applications for our leadership positions will open up towards the end of the spring semester, which will consist of a written application and possibly an online interview, depending on how many people apply. If any member in a leadership position says or commits an act we do not tolerate (promoting anything along the lines of racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc) we will have a discussion with them and our club advisor, Ms. Weller. If they are ultimately terminated, we will open up leadership applications to fill up the role through the methods that were stated earlier. We will also not tolerate members promoting any of the ideas that were stated earlier, and if we catch any members doing said things, we will have a discussion with them and Ms. Weller and most likely remove them depending on the severity of their actions. 
","Southeast Asian people are often overlooked in the Stuyvesant community as well as in the discussion of Asian people in general, and so SEAA is the only culture club that celebrates all kinds of Southeast Asian people, whether that be Thai culture, Filipino culture, etc. SEAA allows for people of these backgrounds to not feel forgotten and help them find others they can relate to and connect with through shared experiences. Without this club, it will be difficult to find people of similar backgrounds.

It is also one of the 6 languages that are available to students to study during their 4 years here at Stuyvesant. Language classes are a completely different type of class than our core ones like English, Math, History, or Science because you are learning something new naturally instead of memorizing or analyzing what you learn from reading textbooks. Our club wants to create an environment where students who are interested in learning about French culture or building upon their current knowledge of the French language are able to come together and do so as a French community! Club members are especially encouraged to help out the club, either in funding or advertisement. Though not required, it will help out the club tremendously and will lead to even more amusing and elaborate activities. This club is low commitment, so members just need to show interest and most importantly have a great time! ","Stuy students with interest can connect and enjoy the club with each other. It's a fantastic way to relax, enjoy some good food, and learn something new. Anyone can play an important role in the club, sharing their own thoughts and experience, and helping out. There is no pressure in meeting any standards and it is a great way to engage with the community. Students are prompted to share the clubs with others which could lead to more attendance which will obviously in turn make the club experience “mieux”. This club will help students express their interest in culture outside of the Americas. This opportunity will be especially beneficial for those studying French in their classes because they will be able to learn about the background of French lifestyle, history, and people instead of just learning about the language itself. It will also provide a relaxing environment, which we all need as Stuy students after a day’s worth of hard work during school. Occasionally, however, we will also plan on holding fun Kahoots to increase the feeling of friendly competition for those students who want things to spice up a bit. We’ll be opening the doors for students to dive into and explore French culture!",https://www.instagram.com/francais_de_stuy/,"Appointing Leaders:
Each year, 2 Co-Presidents shall be chosen based on the following criteria: 1 of the Co-Presidents must have completed the AP French course to have most familiarity with the language and be able to communicate with others in French and help them practice speaking. The second Co-President shall be one who has been deemed by the current Co-Presidents to be the most committed and expressing member during club meetings. Based on this, the current Co-Presidents shall pass on their torch, carrying their French legacy, to their successors. The Co-Presidents shall elect a Vice President of their choice at the start of the following school year. The two new Co-Presidents will have to perform a meeting under the supervision of the current Co-Presidents, who will give suggestions and feedback. Afterwards, they are ready to lead the club.
Impeaching Leaders:
Our impeachment process will be simple. If a leader is found to be disrespectful to the members in any way, or excessively not showing up to meetings, then, the other two leaders (Co-Presidents or Co-President + Vice President) have the right to impeach that leader. If the impeached leader was a Co-President, then, the Vice-President shall become the Co-President replacement. The Co-Presidents shall always select a new Vice President together when that spot is shown to be empty.
","In the French Club, members can vote on what they would like to do next. This is to ensure that we do what our members want so they receive the best for their time. It is meant to be a way to relax, learn new and useful things, and connect with others who share similar interests. The broadness of the club can spread off into a multitude of different topics with completely different backgrounds as well. We can dive deep into real world subjects such as energy consumption, demonstrations, diversity, and much more. ","Once every one to two weeks on a Friday or Monday in a classroom.

This club has Instructors who are skilled in specific martial arts (ex. Karate, Taekwondo) who will teach the skills they have learned to club members. The goal is for each technique to become second nature so members can effectively defend themselves. Classes will be split into Advanced, Intermediate and Beginner classes for whichever level members are suited for. Advanced classes will focus on MMA techniques, providing a full training session during meetings in which students will build their physical and mental fortitude. Intermediate classes will teach a broader spectrum of martial arts techniques and include physical training, helping those who wish to improve if they don’t think they are suited for the advanced classes yet. Beginner classes will focus on teaching specific self-defense techniques, such as specific defenses against grabbing, pinning, and chokeholds. It is entirely okay for any members to not participate in techniques if they are uncomfortable. This club does not endorse bullying, starting conflicts, or fighting. Rather, we wish to promote respect among members and the importance of choosing not to fight when possible.
Depending on interest, Instructors may organize competitions within the club or with other schools in which we would form a competitive team.
","Self defense is an irreplaceable skill that everyone should have. Members of Stuy Martial Arts will learn and practice self defense in a safe environment, while simulating and preparing against harmful situations. Violence is not uncommon on the streets of New York City. Knowledge in self defense techniques can give you self reassurance that you can protect yourself in dangerous areas, and the skills provided by learning martial arts will help no matter where you are in life. This knowledge will also allow people to recognize attack patterns or methods so they know what to be cautious of. The focus of Martial Arts is not only to defend yourself, but also training for physical and mental development. Training with discipline will reward members as they will see their physical capabilities improve, from muscle strength to flexibility and decision making, as well as mental benefits ranging from compassion and respect from training with others to the ability to learn and adapt to different situations. Training in Martial Arts will allow members to improve speed, accuracy, footwork, mind-body coordination, reaction time, and more which can benefit members in their everyday life. Independent from our goal to teach martial arts, members will be able to experience health benefits from training regularly with us. Competiton also stimulates growth and improvement, as competitors will strive to get better to win. ",https://discord.gg/9RVZvtx2PY,"Leadership positions include Instructors, Assistants, and Managers. Instructors lead the overall dojo and teach new martial arts techniques to the club members. Members are expected to listen to the Instructors of the club and follow any restrictions they apply to a meeting activity. Assistants are those who have specific martial arts experiences that they can teach, but may not have enough experience to be Instructors. Assistants will be taught by the Instructors beforehand, and are able to help demonstrate and guide club members during club meetings. Managers are in charge of logistics, recruiting new members into the dojo, promoting the club, and creating + directing a form of communication between the Instructors, Assistants, and students. The transfer of leadership is in the hands of the previous year’s Instructors and Managers. If most of the Instructors are graduating, they will choose a number of skilled members who will uphold the image of the club and show they have leadership capabilities to be the next year’s Instructors. Assistants can also be promoted if they show that they are able to head a class on their own effectively. Manager positions will be chosen by the past Managers and will be filled with the club member who has shown the most dedication to the club, even if they may not be highly skilled when it comes to martial arts. At the beginning of their year, the Instructors shall select 5-6 students to act as Assistants for the club. If leaders are found unsuitable for the club by their peers, an impeachment process shall be held through a private club meeting. Leaders shall be impeached through a vote process among the Instructors, Managers, and Assistants. If more than two-thirds majority vote in favor of impeachment, the leader shall be replaced by the choice of the remaining leaders.
","Stuy Martial Arts is a brand new type of club within Stuyvesant. Many kids at Stuyvesant have martial arts backgrounds, however there is no club that allows them to explore that interest in school, until now. This club provides an environment where students are able to learn techniques that they are able to apply if the time ever comes when they need to physically defend themselves. Not only will our club help teach students martial arts, but it will also help them keep different muscles throughout their body physically active. Our aim is to be able to teach at least 2 new skills during each club meeting and put them to practice. We will not only make this productive, but also fun for our trainees by allowing them to compare their skills and encourage some friendly competition amongst them. After some experience and training, for those interested, we will also provide opportunities to go to local martial arts competitions(if held), which our club can compete in as a whole!

","Stuyvesant AAH is a chapter of the American Assimilation Helpline that matches each tutee to an AAH! tutor to fit each tutee’s specific needs. Members get community service hours while teaching students all over the world. The organization has a global reach, helping out anyone in need through virtual video calls on Google Meet. AAH! sessions are every Sunday from 5-6 PM EST during the school year. Any students who need help with schoolwork or learning the English language are welcome! Club members can select topics that they are comfortable with teaching ranging from curriculum covered from K-12 including but not limited to Middle School Algebra or English; Elementary level reading and writing; AP Calculus AB or BC, a variety of science courses; and introductory python, java, and web development to advance levels of the aforementioned coding courses. We also strive to help our community by organizing monthly volunteer events. During these courses, students will improve their speaking skills and learn how to communicate information effectively through experience. Members can also earn the President’s Volunteer Service Award for outstanding performance. Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Lifetime Achievement Award requirements are 100, 175, 250+, and 4,000+ respectively. Overall, members will gain invaluable speaking, lesson planning, effective and active teaching, and social skills as the Stuyvesant chapter of AAH endeavors to forster a meaningful, productive community.

Outreach coordinators are responsible for promoting the club. New members will be notified about the AAH website and given the google form to sign up for a new tutor account where they will select subject preferences and later sign up for tutoring sessions on the AAH tutoring website. Leadership positions will also be open after a starting period when everyone has been acclimated to the tutoring situation and club members have had the opportunity to provide valuable feedback and insight during the monthly meeting while attending their virtual tutoring sessions. If anyone feels current leadership is inadequately performing their responsibilities, a proposal meeting will be set up to address these issues and if the problem persists, a vote will be taken to remove leadership and appoint new heads. ","Since its inception in 2017, AAH! has extended its reach to eleven states and eight countries, making an impact on around 950 students across the world with about 600 tutors. Whether it be through teaching core academic subjects or computer science skills, members will be gaining valuable experiences which might even lead to an interest in a career in education. The AAH was founded by students for students and hopes to expand to not only academic outreach but also supporting the homeless with initiatives such as contributing dozens of devices and donating school supplies and hosting blood drives. Since then, volunteer and outreach opportunities have expanded to health fairs, urban farming jobs, etc. This club is unique in that it aims to provide help to underserved students who fall into the categories of immigrant, homeless, low-income, and at-risk no matter their location in the world",Once a month for tutor strategy and planning.

Stuyvesant Casual Valorant Club,SCVC,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/SCVC/02bcaf52,The Stuy Casual Valorant Club enforces the fun and arguably more entertaining side of Valorant. We are a community that loves the casual approach.,"We want to bring people together and build a community of casual Valorant gamers. In this community, members will have a good time by playing Valorant and just talking with people around them. This club will be low commitment therefore meetings will be held online through virtual meets every other week. However, we will have an active discord server where you can communicate with the other members and leaders. Members of this club are expected to just have fun and vibe. We also expect members to be respectful to each other to keep the overall vibes high. You don’t even need to know much about Valorant to join, this is a club for anyone who is interested in joining. Join to just chill and have a good time with the rest of the members. We try to separate competitiveness from just casual gaming by having fun games which are more focused on just having fun and improving together instead of trying to compete.","This activity would benefit the community at Stuyvesant High School because its aim is to bring people together of similar interests. There are many students that enjoy gaming but don’t have enough time to become insanely good at it or just want to play for fun, so this would be a place for all of these gamers. We want people to have an enjoyable time playing with their friends and even making new ones through playing Valorant. We also aim for members to be able to talk to each other without feeling awkward or judged. We promote a healthy and safe environment for everyone. Also, this club would help students alleviate some of the stress they might have from homework and tests by playing in a fun environment in Valorant. We strive to give students time on Fridays to take their minds off of their busy weekdays and focus on something fun to do and look forward to at the end of their school day. We know there are a lot of people in our Stuyvesant community that are playing Valorant but don't want to play it as competitively. This is why we are creating this club to bring these people together to form the SCVC.
",https://discord.gg/HgJpzre74s,"At the start of the club, the leadership positions are president, vice president, and director. Leaders are expected to listen to their community and respond to them accordingly as well as hold customs To be appointed a leadership position, the member must be an active member and members with a leadership position can make a vote on which member demonstrated commitment, determination, leadership potential, and helpfulness to the staff and our gaming community. Leadership positions can be taken away through multiple acts of immature behavior (this solely depends on what they did), toxicity, and reports from members. This impeachment process will be dealt with through a google form that members of our group can fill out if they believe that someone who is a director has done something to revoke their position. The vice presidents and president will look through these requests to confirm or reject them as soon as possible. Directors may have many jobs such as hosting customs, creating a group to play, and much more. We will most likely choose directors during the beginning of the school year and at the end during the ending months of the school year for anyone new who has joined and would like to apply.","Our gaming club is unique since we don’t want you or anyone else to feel pressured to play like their life depends on it. We want to make it so people can make the best of their free time. We care more about having fun than winning because at the end of the day the true winners are those who had fun. To us gaming is about having fun, it is about experiencing a whole new perspective in our lives. Instead of playing competitively, you will laugh (that's a guarantee) and your heart rate probably won't increase by 30%.

Some meetings may also include an activity component. For example, members may make lanterns on a meeting near the Lantern Festival. Other meetings may include a food component. For example, members may eat mooncakes on a meeting near the Mid-Autumn Festival. (We will also check with the Clubs and Pubs Department beforehand to make sure the food is allowed. A Gmail will also be send beforehand to check everyone's allergies and diet restrictions to ensure that it is safe for everyone.) The meetings will not include language lessons, since there are currently 302 spoken dialects in China. However, members may speak in their native language to other members if they wish to.","Although a large majority of the Stuyvesant population is of Chinese ethnicity, many students have had minimal exposure to Chinese culture.

Any member who wishes to be one of the two leaders for the next year may answer the Google Form questions. The current leaders will then review each response and decide which members are best suited to be next year's leaders. Leaders will be expected to hold meetings throughout the school year. They must also exhibit good behavior, which includes but is not limited to supporting the members and avoiding any discriminatory behavior. Throughout the school year, if leaders are found to have neglected their role or have exhibited poor behavior, a Google Form will be sent in which the members and the co-leaders may anonymously vote on whether to impeach the leader or not. The opinion of the majority will determine whether the leader will retain their position or not. If there is a tie, the leader will still be impeached.","Chinese Culture Club is the only current club at Stuyvesant that aims to expose its members to Chinese culture in general.

Stuy Movie Night Club,stuymovienightclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuymovienightclub/d62c5f0e,"This activity's mission is to foster a chill environment to rewind and watch other people's movie recommendations. 
","Ever came out of a movie thinking ""Wow..they don't do movies like that any more..""? Or, did you ever just wanted to come have a place to marvel over great movies recommendations to others? Or do you simply want to watch films but just don't know the right one to watch? This activity's purpose is to find ""that '' right movie that may either brighten your mood, bring a few laughs, or even change your outlook in life! Watching movies brings us away from the stresses in our lives and I believe that as Stuy student, that's something we need here and there! Not only that, there's never much appreciation being put out in the film industries as there are so many under-appreciated movies that are true pieces of art which I hope this club can discover and appreciate in this club. But movies don't need to have a life-changing effect on you to be a ""good"" movie!! This club's purpose is to find that ""right"" movie through the help of our club member's movie recommendation. This inclusion hopes to create a welcoming experience to all club members as we value each and everyone's opinion and won't judge others preference of movie genres. Rather, we hope to explore multiple movie genres and make member's discover that they might just have a thing for (for example not literally!!) horror movies!
","As mentioned previously, movies allow us to escape the stresses we experience in life and enter a new reality as we take part in a main character's life. As Stuy students, there are a plethora of things one may be stressing about at the end of a school day (e.g. sleep schedule, bad test grade, homework etc.). We hope to create a chill environment where someone can do-away with those stresses and have the fun they deserve and need after a long time at school. We hope to watch movies based on other club member's movie recommendations to make member's opinions feel valued! A most important benefit is that we are able to watch these movies together and react to emotional/funny and /or dramatic scenes together. We hope to foster a social environment through this and make our club member's feel comfortable with each other. A lot of movies have worthwhile life lessons that we hope to show in our meetings to make our members have a more positive outlook in life. Watching movies in a general sense is already shown to be beneficial to us in its arts (e.g. picture, costumes, sound designs), life lessons taught, information it learns us, togetherness it creates, and inspiration it gives to its viewers! 
",,"Leaders are basically composed of the president and the vice president. We just decide which movie will be shown at each meeting and ensure that each or at least most club members are in favor of the movie chosen. We make sure that the movie recommended by our club members isn't offensive or contains sensitive topics, inappropriate scenes, or too much bad behavior and language displayed. We ensure, in general, that the movie is suitable to be shown to highschool students. We will handle google forms where movie recommendations will be submitted and voted for and we will fairly choose the movie by majority vote. In each meeting, we will ensure that club members are respectful and aren't being too disruptive during a movie being shown. Leaders are also responsible for putting up the movie (using netflix, hulu, disney+ and/or amazon prime). Leaders are appointed by their commitment to doing all of what was listed above and typically google forms will probably be sent out to transfer leadership. Leaders will be removed if they don't fulfill their expectations or (more specific example) show inappropriate movies and/or show disrespect to club members. In general, current leaders of the club select potential candidates 
for a leadership position. After that, a group vote will be conducted through google form to select the president for the next school year. ","Before each meet, google forms will be sent out for any movie recommendations. All movie recommendations will be compiled into another google form in which club members vote for which one they want to see. Movie recommendations that cannot be shown (e.g. let's suppose someone recommends a movie from netflix but I don't have a subscription for it) or are not suitable for highschool students will not be included in the compiled list. In the compiled list, next to the movie title, the movie rating/percentage it is given in rotten tomatoes (trusted movie rating website) will be shown so that club members can have an easier time voting for which movie they want to watch. CommonSenseMedia (popular trusted website for parents to make sure a movie is suitable for their kids) will also be used to determine if the movies selected are high school level. Lastly, (certainly not least) club members are invited to bring snacks so they can create their own mini movie theater experience!

StuyBite,stuybite,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuybite/537c9ceb,The mission of this club is to bring awareness of the different and unique cultures here at Stuyvesant brought by students with different backgrounds.,"This club is to bring together people from different backgrounds and cultures through food by taking pictures of what they eat in their daily lives and researching the significance of the food that relates to their identity and culture. By the end of each month, members are expected to have at least one food that is significant to their lives with a description detailing the importance/historical background and an addition of a recipe. For future meetings, we will share our research among our members, but we promise it would not have a school atmosphere, but instead, we encourage the meetings as a place for people to learn more about one another through their common interest in food and their desire to know more about someone else's culture. We will be providing snacks (from childhood) for each meeting and we also encourage others to bring some snacks that they have eaten in their childhood and share them with us. As the club progresses, it may be expected that besides the monthly research, there will be certain trips to different restaurants to expand our palates. ","Food brings people together as a way to stay connected, learn about a family member by cooking together, celebrate, learn about cultures, and provide comfort. People love food almost as much as they love each other, so together they bring happiness and joy to all. Sometimes in Stuyvesant, we get too caught up in the academic side of the school, but learning about people and what makes up their identity is one of the joys of attending school. This club is a way for people to connect with one another, know more about another person's culture, and broaden their views. This club also helps you realize how the meals that your family cooks can display your identity. By realizing how your meals play such an important role in your daily lives and researching more about this, you can develop a deeper appreciation of food. This club does bring people together with a similar interest in food but this club is to also find more about your identity and to discover more about your culture which may help you connect better with your family members. Everyone can benefit from this even if you are not in the club because we are going to update and post the research we have done on our social media so that everyone can get a taste/bite of what the members have to share. 
",,"We would appoint 2-3 leadership positions or more based on the members and progress of this club. To get a leadership position, they will first be given a writing portion consisting of questions that they will have to answer online on a google form. In the end, we will decide and vote on which one is most fit for the position. This process will be done yearly. Once we deem their answers to be sufficient, we will give them a 10-20 minute interview. We do want to have divisions within the club and have leaders for that, however, we are not certain what those divisions may be, and will update the members. If a leader is acting unfit or is not doing their job properly, please report it to another leader, and all the leaders would come together and decide whether or not that person would be removed from a leadership position. 
","our club is unique in the way that it will accept everyone of all cultures to aim to connect people through food. Not only does this club helps to connect more people, but it is also a place for anyone with a desire to meet new people and experience new cultures. It will be a fun and carefree place to try the waters of understanding people’s culture through their food. This will be a place where you can share something about your culture with other people and find something that connects you with others, therefore creating and deepening friendships and bonds. This club will mostly be centered around food from different cultures but it will not be limited to this. If there is something someone else would like to add about their culture that is not food-related, they are more than welcome to do so and in fact, encouraged to do so. Overall, this place is where you would step into other people’s world and also reflect on what makes you who you are. 
","We will hold both virtual and in-person meetings and this will vary depending on everyone’s availability. We aim to have at least two meetings per month and hopefully, this will gradually increase to at least once a meeting per week. We will be sending out a form that will ask for the days of the week you will be available and update our meeting schedule accordingly. For now, our days will be on either Mondays or Tuesdays.

Biking not only can help physical health, but it can improve mental health as a way to help reduce stress and anxiety. StuyCycles not only benefits people but it also benefits the environment; biking doesn’t release harmful emissions into the environment which, in turn, doesn’t pollute or release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It’s a pollution-free mode of transportation and uses no fossil fuels.

Whether it be connecting with their heritage or learning more about a side interest, anyone can come to explore all that Greece has to offer. Each meeting will start off with a fun slideshow about the country’s history, starting off with exploring all the Greek islands and later on members can create their own informational slides. Additionally, everyone is welcome to share pictures and memories from their personal trips to Greece during any point in the meeting. Following the slides there will be activities and/or quizzes that take up the rest of the club’s duration. After the history portion, members will be encompassed by culture. For the film portion, we will play the old black and white comedy movies from Greece’s cinematic Golden Age and even readouts of ancient Greek plays. Members will also be introduced to basic Greek dance, such as sirtaki and kalamatiano, and play various board games like ταβλι (backgammon). We will also be exploring how the ancient Greeks laid the foundation for modern civilization by discussing architecture, medicine, philosophy, and more. And, of course, Greek gastronomy will be discussed frequently. Every day, members can bring any Greek food or snack item of their choice to the club. One day a year there will be the Food Day where every Greek brings a dish for the members to share.We also aim to march in the annual Greek Independence Day parade on 5th Avenue, members are highly encouraged to participate but one can opt out if necessary. The club serves as a community space that welcomes all socialization. By the end of the school year, everyone in the Hellenic club will be saying “γεια σου” to each other in the hallways.","Stuyvesant, in all its multiculturality, does not have that many Greek students, so our club serves as an opportunity for them to connect. Greek culture is incredibly rich and has permeated across the globe. This club is a community of people who are open to learning about Greece in entertaining ways and within this lies the opportunity to be immersed in the lesser known aspects of Greece like Greek film, Greek wildlife, and Greek history along with understanding its influence. Greeks will also be able to directly share their experiences with their culture to those that aren’t familiar with it. As we study science, discuss philosophy, analyze mathematics and learn about medicine, we often do not realize that most of the words and theoretical foundations of each are from ancient Greece. But why were the Ancient Greeks able to contribute so much? What led Winston Churchill in October 1940 to say, “Until now we used to say the Greeks fight like heroes. Now we shall say, “Heroes fight like Greeks!”? What is in it that shapes the Greek spirit even now and makes it so strong? By exploring the culture and history of Hellenism we will be inspired to also pursue excellence (“arete”), which is an integral part of Stuyvesant.

The removal of any member necessitates a vote. Initiation of a vote requires two members. ¾ of the club population is needed for a vote to pass and that member will be removed from the club and will be prohibited from attending meetings.

Our goal is to give plane lovers a place to hang out and discuss anything about flying. We will be running lessons on the history and basics behind flight, possibly having guest speakers talk about their experiences in the aviation manufacturing and service industries, and give students access to widely-used flight simulator software, including FAA-approved flight simulator, X-Plane 12. Towards the end of the year, we may plan to take a field trip to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space museum, where students will be able to take a look at the Concorde, Space Shuttle Enterprise, and other military and civilian aircraft and spacecraft. For more advanced students, we will also be running a series on military aviation (starting with World War I and running until contemporary military aviation history) throughout the years and commercial aviation.

Members are not required to attend each meeting, whether virtual or in-person. However, we would advise attending some sessions because we’re offering chances for our members to test normally-paid software.","It is easier to make friends who share the same interest(s) as you. The more you have in common with them, the more likely you are to become great friends with them. Sharing an interest or two can also allow you to get to know one another better. At StuyAviators, we aim to create a safe space for all where you can hang out with other people who share the same interests as you. You may discuss topics that you are knowledgeable about as well as learn new information about planes from others. StuyAviators is a great place to make new friends while learning everything there is to know about personal, commercial, and military aviation!

A career in Aviation may be a possible career choice for some students at Stuyvesant. Jobs in the aviation industry, especially as pilot or copilot, have some of the best salaries in the world. We aim to help those interested in becoming pilots or copilots (among other jobs) achieve their dream by maintaining their interest and knowledge in aviation before they go off to college or flight school, but also assisting with job requirements, etc, if possible.

Finally, if you have a school project that is in any way related to aviation, StuyAviators is an incredible opportunity to learn about aviation in depth for your next presentation or assignment. We have different series at different levels, starting with basic aviation principles to commercial aviation and becoming a pilot to military aviation and how aircraft changed warfare. Our members are very happy to help you understand aviation and everything it has to offer.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/stuyaviators,"Leadership positions are appointed based on experience, when they joined, and current standing. Position names are based on people you would find on a plane. The current positions are Captain (President), First Officer (Vice President), Flight Engineer (Admin), Flight Attendant (Moderator), First Class (Experts), Business Class (Veterans), and Economy Class (Member). Sub-positions such as Head Flight Attendant may be created based on needs.

Moderators may apply via an application. To be promoted to Admin, you must be an existing Moderator with good standing in the community, as well as having this position for several months with little to no infractions. To become an Expert, you must show in-depth knowledge in a certain field (ex: Commercial, Military, Manufacturing, etc). To become a Veteran, you must be in the club for at least one year (Time is most likely tracked through the Discord Server).

If one of the leaders will not be at Stuyvesant the following year, leadership of the club at the end of the school year will be transferred to the member who has been in the club for the longest, who has (one of) the highest leadership positions, and who has a great standing in the community. If more than 2 members qualify to be the next leader(s) of the club, this may be settled via a vote among all the members of the club.

A 'points' system will be employed. Each member, regardless of leadership position, will start off with 0 points. Each infraction committed may result in points being added depending on the severity of the violation. When a member reaches 5 points, they will be given a light punishment (ex. a timeout, warning). When a member reaches 10 points, they will receive a more serious punishment (ex. a longer timeout, blacklisted from a meeting). The highest number of points any member may accumulate is 15 points. When a member reaches 15 points, they will be banned from the club. They may appeal their ban via a link that will be sent to them after a week. Each member may only appeal once. The point limit of members who appeal successfully will be 5. Once a member receives 5 points after successfully appealing, they will be permanently banned until the next school year.","StuyAviators is Stuyvesant’s first club dedicated exclusively and fully to aviation. We aim to provide a community where people interested in aviation can make new friends as well as learn some new things. When learning about the basics of aircraft, how they work, and how to fly them, we use simulators. Simulators, at its core, are basically games that attempt to simulate real life. Additionally, if permitted by the Student Union, we may even be able to host meetings where members will be able to fly aircraft in X-Plane 12 or another great flight simulator using a physical controller (ie. a yoke, joystick). ","Members of StuyAviators will gather together at least once a month to hang out and have fun. Meetings can either be in person or online depending on the availability of the majority of members. In person meetings will generally be held on either Tuesday or Friday after 10th period, and online meetings will generally be held either Tuesday or Friday nights, or over the weekends. During these meetings (depending on whether in-person or online), we may play games associated with aviation, as well as learning about new planes, or the science behind flying. If the Student Union permits, we may even be able to host flight simulations inside the classroom from time to time.

Stuy Graphic,graphic,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/graphic/73bb7abf,StuyGraphic aims to engage students in the practice of graphic and web design through the visual communication of ideas and messages.,"StuyGraphic serves to engage its members in the field of design and use it as a tool to communicate their messages and ideas. Simply put, graphic design can be considered art with a purpose. It involves a creative and systematic plan to visually represent the values and objectives of an individual or organization through symbols, images, and text. Through workshop lessons and solo/group projects, the club hopes to encourage an environment of problem-solving and creativity for its members, whether it be determining how to best layout a magazine editorial or visualize a data system. In today’s growing economy of visual consumption, graphic design has become not just a visual aesthetic, but rather an essential tool for businesses and individuals to communicate their ideas effectively and to have their messages stand out. StuyGraphic thus endeavors to make design accessible for the student population and for them to learn how to engineer creative solutions using both graphic and web design. ","There is a wide range of benefits that StuyGraphic has. The club primarily focuses on expanding and furthering interests in graphic design for students to invest their time in or even embark on a new career path. Members can utilize what they’ve learned in their own personal work through the creative problem-solving and visual storytelling that the club hopes to foster. Through the intersection of technology and art, graphic design can help students understand what kind of visual elements work and what don’t when they engage in a creative project for English class or develop their own personal project to be shared on social media. Simply acquiring a basic understanding of graphic design will allow students to convey a message of credibility and professionalism in whatever work they hope to pursue, which will make sure that their ideas are clear and stand out. In addition, StuyGraphic offers an environment for creative collaboration in which members can work on group projects, deliver feedback, and share resources with one another, whether a company’s new branding or an artist they’ve recently come across. Ultimately, the club hopes to provide each and every member with the skills to think as an artist and problem-solver.",,"Leadership positions for StuyGraphic require a fair amount of dedication and interest in the club. Club leaders are expected to handle each meeting prepared with an itinerary of what they hope to teach and what they want their members to take away. Leaders should prepare any creative design projects for their members to work on and be able to facilitate a discussion or critique. Additionally, leaders should search for opportunities, competitions, and programs that might be beneficial for students if they want to pursue their interests in graphic design further. New leaders are appointed at the end of the school year through an application where members will have to fill out a Google form to either become the president or vice-president, along with other positions such as outreach. If a leader fails to meet such guidelines and repeatedly falls short of expectations, they will be removed from their role and officially impeached. The impeachment process can happen if most club members vote leaders off through a poll. After an application process, one manager will help log the members’ activities and will be a strong candidate for a leadership position in the event that a spot opens.","What makes StuyGraphic unique is for engaging its members in independent or collaborative projects related to elements of graphic design, such as typography, color, and shape. By having students participate in these projects like creating their own brand identity or learning how to design their own promotional poster, it allows for members to partake in a unique blend of artistic problem-solving and technological handiwork, while also sharing their work with the student body. Additionally, if members are interested, students will be given the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of design competitions to further pursue their interests in graphic design. At the end of the year, members will also have the ability to showcase their design work through the club’s annual publication where it will be shown through the club’s social media platforms. Moreover, we are looking to worth with CodeSpeak Labs for possible upcoming projects. 
","StuyGraphic is a medium-commitment club, where every week members will learn about an element of graphic design, get acquainted with a design program, or work and share their creative work and process. All students are welcome, and no prior experience is necessary, just passion and insight!

Stuy Open Mic,openmic,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/openmic/3159bc79,Stuy Open Mic strives to be a low-commitment place where everyone can share something they've been working on! ,"Stuy open mic is a space where people can show off any talent that they have or anything that they want to share with a larger audience. Bring something you wrote, something you drew, a song or a dance number you know, a presentation, a story, or anything else at all that you can think of. Also, a guitar will be provided at the meetings for anyone who knows a song on guitar. Stuy open mic will meet twice a month usually on fridays (or on the last day of the week if there is no school on friday.) We are very low commitment -- just show up whenever you can and whenever you have something to share or want to see / hear what other people have to share! We aim to form a community of people who feel they can bond over a shared interest in whatever they enjoy. ","Stuy open mic will benefit the stuyvesant community by being a space that aims to make people feel like they can share and / or explore their own talents and learn about what other people can do as well. We would also provide something that can give students a means of respite from a long day / week of working and studying. Additionally, by definition we are a very open and welcoming space, and we also want to help people discover their own abilities more and perhaps find groups of people who enjoy the same things as they do, allowing connections to be made by people who have shared interests. Through the open mic, students can also practice speaking or performing publicly or in front of a group of people, which can build individual confidence and empower other students to do the same. Our goal is that at the end of every meeting, everyone will feel that their voice has been sufficiently heard and to potentially be inspired by other people as well. We expect to be a fairly small community and we also hope that this can allow people to develop connections within the whole group that shows up as well. ",,"Leadership positions: There will be two co-presidents, both of which are current juniors and will pass on the roles to someone else at the end of their senior year. ( This is also how the club got handed down to the current president after the last one graduated last year. ) The co presidents will be responsible for planning meetings and booking the room for meetings. There are no specific protocols general members are expected to follow. Presidents will be removed if they can no longer attend meetings on the appointed day ( likely friday ) at all or if they are not in attendance at three consecutive meetings. In the case in which they miss three consecutive meetings, a new co president would be elected by popular vote. A vote would be held at the next meeting after the previous co president was un-appointed. The vote would be between two or three members who regularly attend meetings. ","Stuy open mic is the only club that gives people a chance to share anything that they created without having a higher level of specificity. We do not have any set requirements or expectations for what people can or should bring, so we can also act as a sounding board of sorts for any ideas people have or talents that they feel they have not yet found a niche for somewhere else inside or outside of stuyvesant.

Stuy Coral Reef Club,stuycoralreefclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuycoralreefclub/724fdb26,This activity's mission is to help members use chemical and biological processes to rehabilitate the degrading reefs in our school's fish tanks. ,"Club members essentially work to maintain a biological system. Club members will help in reef maintenance by cleaning out fish tanks, growing and breeding super corals, picking out their own fishes to put in the tanks, and even picking out which coral species they want to help grow. They will help clean out fish tanks using protein skimmers (a type of mechanical filtration), algae and mangroves (a type of biological filtration; helps digest the excess phosphates and nitrates in the coral). Mr. McClellan will help teach us reef techniques to help grow a better home to the neglected fishes in Stuyvesant. Members can have potential research opportunities by observing reef growth and studying how a reef system functions. Members can each be assigned special roles towards helping the maintenance of these tanks and help strengthen and become pros on how to build a better home for the fishes of Stuyvesant. 
","The activity helps foster a productive and learning environment for all members of the club. People interested in studying marine biology, helping the environment, showing off their ultimate cleaning skills, helping conduct research, or just interested in helping fish are all welcomed in this club. This club helps members learn how we can use biological, chemical, and mechanical processes to help make a reef ecosystem thrive. Members learn to be reliable and responsible as they are relied on carrying out specific functions towards building a new ecosystem on scratch. This activity is beneficial as it works to improve the home of the long neglected fish in Stuyvesant whose habitats experienced a sharp decline in quality due to neglect during the two years of quarantine. Members can gain first-hand experience into how an ecosystem responds to the biological and chemical processes it undergoes as they all work to grow a reef system. Each club meeting, club members can observe the growth and interaction of the corals and gain a better knowledge on how aquatic ecosystems work from a birds-eye view. The community and interdependence built from this club helps members learn good leadership skills and teach them how to be more responsible. ",,"As of now, leadership positions available are presidents and vice president roles. Essentially, they are appointed through their commitment towards the club and efforts and responsibility they offer in each meeting. At the end of the school year, potential candidates are determined between Mclellan and the current president and vice president of the club. They will select potential candidates that have these qualities and will then conduct a group vote amongst club members through google form. The candidate that receives majority votes will then be appointed for the next school year. If current leaders don't ensure each club meeting runs smoothly (e.g. everyone needs to know what to do and how to do it, be careful of what they put in and out of tanks, and be respectful to everyone), shows disrespect to club members and/or show carelessness on how they handle the tanks, then they will receive a strike. An accumulation of three strikes will result in impeachment. ","This club allows you to grow a reef system from scratch! Club members play an active role towards providing a better quality of life to Stuyvesant's fishes and corals. Not only will they be able to observe the growth of the reef systems they create, they will also be able to choose which corals they want to grow in the tank as well! Not only that, club members can even pick out new fishes to live in the ecosystem that they all worked to create through teamwork, leadership, and responsibility. Last, but certainly not least, this club doesn't require high commitment. In fact, it's your choice to determine how much commitment you want to offer! Whether you attend some meetings or even all, your efforts will be appreciated nonetheless! ","Our meeting schedule varies through the year, but we meet at least once every two weeks.

Stuyvesant Gun Safety Coalition,gun-safety-coalition,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/gun-safety-coalition/94959222,"Stuy Gun Safety Coalition is a movement dedicated to promoting civic engagement, education, and direct action by youth to eliminate gun violence.","Every day, more than 110 Americans are killed with guns. As issues surrounding gun violence and a lack of government action to prevent it continue to manifest in students’ daily lives, they can look to Stuy’s Gun Safety Coalition as an outlet to learn about and fight gun violence on the local level. Through a direct partnership with the March for Our Lives and Everytown for Gun Safety parent organizations, Gun Safety Coalition aims to educate, fundraise, and advocate on behalf of the organization's mission. We strive to advocate against the five central proponents of gun violence: gun glorification, political apathy, poverty, armed supremacy, and America’s mental health crisis. Having to hear about new mass shootings, oftentimes in a school just like our own, creates an environment of fear and unrest that inhibits students from feeling safe. Our purpose is to offer students—while maybe not the promise that they need not fear—an opportunity to advocate for gun control laws and steps to truly make a difference. We will take action by advocating for common-sense gun safety laws through phone banking and canvassing as well as registering voters. The club also focuses on educating the Stuyvesant community and working on initiatives to help those affected by gun violence such as fundraisers and donation drives. In a generation deeply impacted by this crisis, Gun Safety Coalition emphasizes the importance of processing the emotions and fears regarding gun violence that impact our communities.","The Stuy Gun Safety Coalition strives to end gun violence in the nation through education and activism. We hope to raise awareness of the issue of gun violence in America and help pass gun-regulation laws to end gun violence for good, as well as provide support to those impacted by such violence. This club is a great way for members to get involved in activism, community service, and policymaking. Some ways we hope to enact change are to organize protests in our communities, write letters to our representatives, create artwork, and write pieces to spread the word of our message. Our members will gain the opportunity to be educated on gun violence and spread their voices. We will be giving presentations on the dangers and statistics of gun violence. We will also organize fundraisers to help raise money for the families affected by gun violence. Additionally, we will organize voter registration drives to educate people on the importance of voting when it comes to gun violence as well as get people to register to vote. Members will be able to volunteer with both March for Our Lives and Everytown for Gun Safety directly through their national teams. Along with making change, the club will strive to understand the gun crisis on a deeper level. Through a historical lens, members will understand how America ended up in this position, and how other social systems continue to intersect with gun-related violence. Our direct activism will also enhance an already successful movement of teenagers around the country. This sense of mutually supporting and being supported by a wide body of students passionate about gun reform will enhance and expand the Stuyvesant world.
",,"The following list includes the intended leadership positions and members for this organization; however, it is subject to change depending on the performance and demand from the members after running successfully their first year: - President: The president will be responsible for leading almost all of the weekly meetings (with exceptions to days when there are guest speakers scheduled to give a brief talk to the club members). The succeeding individual for this position will be determined based on an interest application form and an interview process that will be conducted by the leadership team of this club. - Vice-President: This position will entail catering to the needs of the members and being the first point of contact whenever an issue arises with regards to the members or the organization as a whole. Appointment for this position will be the same as that of the President. - Secretary: Secretaries will be responsible for taking minutes (notes and key points from each meeting) and sharing it with the rest of the leadership team. Appointment for this position is the same as the previous positions listed above. - Publicity Officer: This position will require the individual to be responsible for the marketing aspect of the organization (such as catering to interested students at club fair, developing flyers for interested students, etc). Appointment for this position is the same as the previous positions listed above. - Depending on how large the club grows and how manageable work is for club leaders, the club can include more central leadership roles (Communications Lead, Resource Lead, Events Lead, Social Lead, Community Outreach Lead). - Members: Students who are interested in joining this organization can express their interest by filling out a form at club fair or simply reaching out to any of the leadership team. If any member is falling behind and/or failing to complete their duties, they will be referred to the Vice-President for a brief meeting to discuss any club issues and their future in the organization. If this is a persistent issue with an individual member, then the leadership team will all schedule a meeting to vote on the membership status for the individual.","The gun crisis in America affects all of us, so the club will be a safe space for any students interested. No prior knowledge or experience is required to show up to join the club. StuySDA also has the unique backing of two large and stable organizations, Students Demand Action (Everytown For Gun Safety) and March For Our Lives, which will both provide the club with ample resources, guidance, funding, and most importantly, a network of other schools with which to collaborate to create a stronger impact. This will effectively be a way for Stuyvesant students to make connections with other students around the country interested in social advocacy. The Stuy Gun Safety Coalition is also in communication with the Safety Department at Stuyvesant, giving it a unique connection to the school and potential to help.","We will usually meet weekly on either Mondays or Tuesday (schedule permitting), with the occasional opportunity for extraneous events.

Clay Charm Club,claycharms,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/claycharms/51b44844,Clay Charms teaches members how to make miniature clay creations while providing a place to relax and enjoy a common interest.,"Meetings are relaxed and aren't mandatory, but every two meetings we will start on a new project. So every other meeting we will start on teaching a new model for a charm, and during the subsequent meeting after the charms have dried, members can paint (the fine lines are painted with toothpicks) and finalize charms as well as bring them home. Charms will be stored by the leaders of the club during the period between meetings while the charms dry (members will have labelled compartments in which they can store their charms.) We will provide all the materials required for any project that we start. Members are not required to follow along with these objectives, however, and will be free to work on personal projects or even schoolwork they've been putting off. Members can also seek help from leaders during any part of the creation process of the charms. We will primarily be working with air dry clay, so charms are relatively fragile and cannot be made into accessories. ","The Clay Charms Club cultivates skills such as organization, sequencing, planning, and perseverance. While crafting seems simple, when trying to sculpt or render an image in clay, you need to first break said image into shapes and figure out how to combine shapes in order to create your final images. Physical dexterity is also cultivated by making these charms, as you are working with small amounts of clay and creating precise shapes and small lines being painted.

The club also helps members by providing both a community and supplies. Members who might try starting such a hobby alone might be discouraged and give up if they continually mess up when beginning. By providing a community, we encourage and provide guidance whenever people mess up. Additionally, while the air dry clay is relatively cheap, it is still an investment for members who may be trying out a new hobby and are not sure whether they would wan to continue. By providing the materials, the club encourages people to try making clay charms by taking away the risk of wasting money. 

While these air-dry clay charms are too fragile to be made into accessories, they are a cheap and low-risk way to get into charm making, and encourages members to continue engaging these creative skills. Members can bring these charms home as cute collectibles, providing both serotonin and confidence boosts, as the charms are concrete evidence of the effort they have put into them. ",https://www.instagram.com/stuyccc/,"The different leadership positions are: President, Communications Manager, and Technician. A vice or co-president can be appointed if the club grows large enough that such a position is necessitated. The President decides when the meetings are and leads meetings, Communications Manager will send out emails notifying members of future meetings and sending out any announcements, and the Technician adds the meetings to StuyActivities and runs the social media accounts. The cost of materials will be split among leaders.

At the end of the year, a Google Form will be sent out listing these positions so that members can choose what positions they want. In order to acquire a position, members of the club must have attended at least one third of the meetings in a given school year. The more meetings a member has attended, the higher the chance they will be considered for the position. If there are a surplus of applicants, there will be an short ""interview"" in which we will gauge the applicant's time availability, dedication to the club, and their skills pertaining to the club's activity. New leaders should be approved by all the current leaders before appointment.

If necessary (if leaders are not fulfilling their responsibilities, or if are abusing their power), leaders can be voted out if the other leaders unanimously agree to remove them. All changes in leadership will be announced to the club, and there will be full transparency for any reasoning behind the changes.","Making clay crafts is currently a niche that is large unfilled in the Stuyvesant Community. While there are various other crafting clubs, they do not deal with clay, the inarguably most convenient crafting medium (it sticks to itself, so it's less likely to find small scraps of it all over the floor, and does not require any real tools to deal with, like scissors or jewelry making tools.) Members do not have to be artistically gifted or particularly creative in order to create something cute, as club leaders will provide clear instructions in how to create the intended model.","Our meetings will usually be on Thursdays and Fridays, but that will depend on member availability.

Speech and Debate,snd,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/snd/d00e5a2a,Stuyvesant Speech and Debate consists of six student-run teams/formats dedicated to the art of competitive public speaking and argumentation.,"Stuyvesant Speech and Debate is composed of 6 categories: Congressional Debate, Public Forum Debate, Policy Debate, Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Parliamentary Debate, and Speech. The primary purpose of Stuyvesant Speech and Debate is to help create a welcoming environment for students that are interested in public speaking and discourse to learn in. New members will be sorted into their teams through a tryout process facilitated by varsity members. They will then learn the fundamentals of their respective events through labs, as organized and taught by Novice Directors and veteran members. Once they have the fundamentals down, novices will begin to compete locally as the season begins in the fall and progresses throughout the year. Members will go on to spend years on the team, progressing through learning the ins and outs of their circuits and through experience. By senior year, they will become seasoned competitors and mentors, passing on their knowledge and the values of the National Speech and Debate Association down to younger members.","When new members join the team, they are not only taught the fundamentals of their event-Congress, PF, Policy, LD, Parli, or Speech-but are also instilled with the values of hard work, ambition, ethics, and the ability to participate in public discourse to make a difference. On the team, students grow to become leaders who not only inspire future members but also spread the values learned into their communities. Through participation, members learn useful research and public speaking skills, in addition to keeping up with politics, along with civil, social, and economic issues. Stuy Speech and Debate provides a community where students find a platform to expand their worldview, increasing their knowledge regarding foreign and domestic policy. What many members find most rewarding is the community and relationships formed outside of their own school community. Speech and Debate offers dozens of opportunities for students to participate in the national competitive circuit. Since students are able to compete on a national level, they are given the opportunity to meet people from all over the United States, to travel to prestigious colleges and invitationals. It is important to note that we offer need-based financial aid, making the event readily accessible to students of all backgrounds. This means that everyone has an equal opportunity to learn valuable research and argumentation skills, make cherished friendships, join and contribute to a community like no other, and learn to make change in the world through the power of their voice.",,"All student leadership positions are appointed by the faculty advisor/director of the program with recommendations from the previous year’s officers. On the executive board are the president and team manager, who work closely with the faculty advisor to take care of anything and everything such as teamwide communication, logistics, personnel, legal forms, booking hotels, registering everyone for tournaments, etc. In addition, they also work closely with the team-specific leaders to ensure that everything that pertains to that team is running smoothly. In Congress, Public Forum, Policy, and Lincoln Douglas, and Parliamentary, each team has a captain, JV director(s) and novice director(s), admin number dependent on team size. Each captain is in charge of overseeing their event. Their responsibilities include, but are not limited to, tournament registration, collecting tournament forms and checks for the executive board/faculty advisor, keeping track of tournament results and monitoring varsity practices. The JV director acts as a helping hand, running practices for everyone who competes in the JV division. The novice director(s) works to provide an education and curriculum to help novices navigate the world of speech and debate. Finally, there is the extemp coordinator whose job entails the same duties as captains would for other events, but allows for them to focus on extemp because of the nuances that make it different from other speech events. People who have leadership positions in their junior year, like novice and jv directors, are often appointed captain their senior year because of their experience leading the team. In subdivisions of the team with multiple novice directors, the adult coach of the division, or the head of Speech and Debate, Ms. Sheinman, makes that decision. For president, people who are interested in the position after their junior year contact Ms. Sheinman, who then conducts interviews and makes a decision either appointing one president, two co-presidents, or a president and a team manager.
Impeachment is rare and occurs if someone violates the rules of the school or behaves in a way unfitting of a leader of the team. If a student leader is accused of a disciplinary concern that comes to Ms. Sheinman from the school administration, they collaborate and discuss if removal from their position should be considered on a case by case basis. For all other concerns, they should be reported to Ms. Sheinman, who, in collaboration with coaches from the format, will decide removal.","Stuyvesant Speech and Debate is the only club at Stuy that competes in the events of speech and debate. Stuy Speech and Debate are also the only ones with membership to the National Catholic Forensics League, the National Speech and Debate Association, and the Urban Debate League. With approximately 200 active members, we are also one of the largest, if not the largest activity and family in the Stuyvesant community. No other activity provides a platform for public discourse/argumentation, current events, domestic and international policy, and public speaking the way that we do. In addition, Stuyvesant Speech and Debate is a no-cut team. The club does not restrict membership on any basis-whether it be race, gender, ethnicity, commitment to other clubs, grade, skill, etc. There is also no prerequisite required for joining the team.","During the season, which starts just 1-2 weeks into the school year, teams will hold meetings once or twice a week that generally last until 5 PM. At the peak of tournament season, particularly the week(s) before prestigious national tournaments, teams will hold meetings and practice rounds up to five days a week. Students also tend to take the time to set up sessions with coaches that fit both the student and coach’s schedules. During the offseason, teams will meet as frequently as once a week.","['tuesday', 'thursday', 'wednesday', 'monday', 'friday']",high,"['s&d', 'debate']",,"Erica Lung - Creator

","The purpose of the club is to collect donations and research what we, as students, could do to provide aid to Ukraine, which is currently in a damaged state due to the ongoing war. Students that hope to contribute to Ukraine's well being, or to the well being of communities in general, will feel accomplished as they are actively working towards organizing donations through this committee. On relaxed days that the club isn't working towards a specific donation event, we will converse about Ukrainian, Eastern European, and Slavic culture, and Ukrainian treats such as candy will be provided. Through research, we will work towards educating students within and outside the committee of the current state Ukraine is in. Through this learning and advertising, students will be persuaded to work towards the benefit of Ukraine through involvement of this committee, specifically, the effort, research, and time in organizing donations for Ukraine within Stuyvesant. 
","This committee will directly benefit Ukraine as we will be collecting and organizing donations.
This committee will offer students who are interested in volunteering and public service a way to directly contribute to those in need. It also allows for a sense of community as students will feel connected to their Ukrainian or Russian culture. We hope to set up a stable foundation and little by little, the committee will build and accumulate more and more members and donations. We will ensure this will continue in the future when leadership positions will eventually lie in the hands of future students. We don’t expect to make grand donations from the start, but by conversing and coming up with ideas, and increasing involvement we are sure to make an evident impact. As we mentioned before, the committee will also serve as a space of cultural appreciation in which we expect to establish a close knit community interested in Ukrainian culture. We also hope to provide comfort and support to students who are emotionally affected by the conflict in Ukraine. We understand and will acknowledge the worry of those who have family in Ukraine, and the grief that anyone could experience after learning of the state Ukraine is in right now. Therefore, we hope this committee not only directly provides aid to Ukraine, but also provides a sense of peace and unity within those willing to stand up for the suffering in Ukraine.

Stuy Pediatrics is dedicated to educating students about thriving in medical science, specifically as a pediatrician or pediatric surgeon. While there are other medical-related clubs, this one focuses solely on working with youth. By joining this club, students will be provided with tools, as well as hands-on experience, that will aid them in the pediatric field. Meetings will feature lessons on mental and physical illnesses in children, as well as signs to diagnose these illnesses. Members of this club will perform make-shift labs and get to explore simulations that will model their work in the future. On top of this, members will receive insight into how to pursue a career in this field. Attendance for this club is not mandatory, but given that we only meet once or twice a month, most members should try not to miss out. ","Stuy Pediatrics will benefit the Stuyvesant community by deep-diving into an area of the medical profession never before explored in this way. Students will receive insight into different areas of a child's anatomy and will be able to point to why certain illnesses may occur. They will also be able to diagnose diseases from listed symptoms. The information being learned in Stuy Pediatrics's meetings can be applied to classroom settings as well, especially science classes. We will aim to host guest speaker events later on in our club's journey which will be open to all of Stuyvesant. These events will be able to give not only our members but also other Stuyvesant students information on how to achieve a career in this field, as well as how to succeed in it. Simulations and videos will also present real-life applications of symptoms and diagnosis which will enable students to be able to recognize this on their own. Stuy Pediatrics aims to host meetings in a way that will allow the Stuy community to apply what they have learned inside those meetings to the outside world. Stuy Pediatrics hopes that the students that join this club will be better prepared for premed and a career following. ",,"President and vice president are already assigned. However, other leadership positions will be available. Other positions will be outreach manager(s), IT manager(s), and graphic design leader(s). We also hope to appoint leaders-in-training next year so that Stuy Pediatrics' legacy can carry on into future school years. Appointments will be conducted via open-app google forms. These applications will be anonymous- the names will be hidden from the president and vice president- so that leaders can be picked without bias being taken into account. Once the school year is over, each leader will be asked how they feel about keeping their position for the following school year. If any leader wishes to end their term or is graduating that year, a google form will open for that role. Leaders will be held to a three-strike system. Failure of a leader to respect or follow the expectations held for them will result in one strike and a warning. Three strikes will result in them losing their role as leader.","Stuy Pedriatics is unique because it focuses specifically on the pediatric and childhood development subsection of medical science. Stuy Pediatrics is based solely on studying this medical specialty and pushing our members into retrieving as much experience and knowledge in the particular area as possible. Of course, any student remotely interested in the medical field can join this club, but the main goal is to offer information for this area as opposed to the medical field as a whole.

","Nutriderms aims to create a fun environment for students interested in learning more about dermatology and nutrition. Its members will brainstorm ideas, conduct research on the effects of different foods on the skin, and create engaging weekly podcasts on Spotify which students can listen to wherever they are, making dermatology more accessible and fun to learn about. Through the weekly questionnaires and interactive posts on social media, the club also strives to answer specific questions that people may have, which can be general questions about advices and academics, or questions specific to dermatology Additionally, we hope to create a safe space for students to talk about their own experiences and ideas which will be fulfilled through the guest speaker episodes. However, in order to create such a platform, general members must be active participants of the podcast and attend weekly meetings which are mandatory. Based on the meetings, the members will also have to complete certain tasks they’ve agreed upon. This club will have a place for anyone, with many different positions such as graphic designers, speakers, social media managers, researchers, and Spotify manager. If, for any reason, members are unable to attend, they should contact the leaders beforehand. There will be a shared document between all of the members which contains meeting information and brainstorming.","Nutriderms gives Stuyvesant students an opportunity to learn about the fields of dermatology and nutrition which are often neglected when thinking about medicine as a possible career path. Even for those who find out that they may not be interested in pursuing a path in medicine, there is a lot to be taken away. First, our club creates a fun environment for students to make new connections as you’ll be able to find others with common interests as you. Students who join this club are also given an opportunity to practice researching, speaking, and collaboration skills which are necessary for a student’s success here at Stuyvesant High School. However, it does so in a stake-free environment, giving students who are more shy an opportunity to speak about topics they are interested in without having the pressure of making mistakes as podcasts are often very casual and fosters a safe space for people to speak about what comes to their mind. The information that we obtain through research about dermatology and nutrition can be applied to better our lifestyles, making great impacts on our choices in diet and skincare. For anyone interested in this club, there is no experience required so we can all learn and grow together. 
",https://www.instagram.com/stuynutriderms/,"Currently, there are five leadership positions in the club: the social media manager, the Spotify manager, the graphic designers, the lead researchers, and the podcast hosts. There is a maximum of 2 people per position (with the exception of the social media manager and Spotify manager which will have one individual per position). The social media manager is responsible for managing Nutriderms’ instagram account in order to promote the club and interact with the listeners. They will be in charge of posting weekly questionnaires on instagram, collecting data on any questions that people may want to ask for future podcasts and asking for possible guest speakers. The Spotify manager will be in charge of posting the weekly podcasts on Spotify, creating brief descriptions for each episode. Both of these positions will work closely with the graphic designer who may assist in creating graphics for posts, stories, and podcast covers. The lead researcher will communicate with members of Nutriderms, discussing certain foods the members may want to focus researching on for the weekly podcasts. The podcast hosts will be in charge of discussing the findings of the research in a more entertaining way and addressing questions that were collected through the social media questionnaires. They will also introduce guest speakers, making them feel safer by guiding them with specific questions. Those interested in taking leadership positions can apply through google form which will be sent out to its members and be available on the StuyActivities page when completed. The applications will be reviewed by the leaders of the club, and because no prior experience is needed, as long as you express an interest and dedication to the club, you will most likely be able to get a leadership position. However, failure to complete what is expected of them as listed above (which also includes attending the mandatory weekly meetings) will result in a strike. After three strikes, the president and other leaders will replace the student with another individual interested in the leadership role","What makes this club unique is that it is the only club in the school that centers itself around dermatology which is a growing field in our modern world. It also makes dermatology more accessible as the weekly podcasts are posted on Spotify, thus, you can listen to it on your way to school or in your free time. Even for those not willing to necessarily dedicate themselves to the club, they can also become involved and ask questions they want the podcasts to address, thereby fostering a safe space for students to get to know each other and learn. 
","Our meeting schedule may vary throughout the year, but we plan to hold an in person meeting at least once a month to foster closer relationships between the members.

3D Printing,3D,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/3D/23a7e3e7,This organization is about helping people make the most of the 3D printing services that Stuy offers and ensuring that 3D printing at Stuy stays free.,"The primary purpose of this club is to allow people to design and print anything they want to create by using CAD. Anyone can use the 3D printers in the Innovation Lab, despite them mainly being for Science Olympiad. Our goal is to make sure that the 3D printers stay available as a resource for everyone, as they are extremely helpful for personal projects. Also, we want to make people aware that they can use the 3D printers, as currently they are quite hard to find and the Innovation Lab makes them seem exclusively for Science Olympiad. We also aim to help people learn how to use CAD, as being able to CAD is an extremely useful tool in designing and creating anything. Also, we will teach people how to maintain the 3D printers, as they require regular maintenance. Overall, we hope to get people interested in the engineering and design process, from the first step of learning CAD. 

","This club aims to make the printers accessible to anyone by guiding them through using the specialized software needed for printing. This will let more people use the printers and lower the failure rate for the printers by making sure that all prints are configured correctly. This club will also formalize the maintenance schedule of the printers, making sure they are well cared for. Because no one club controls the printers, the maintenance history of the printers has been spotty and as a result the printers are starting to break down. The club will take over repair and maintenance from the Science Olympiad team, which currently cares for them. Also, we will provide assistance to people who are struggling with classes such as Drafting and Woodworking, where CAD is a necessary skill to have. In addition to this, being able to print parts can be useful for a variety of subjects, such as biology or chemistry. 3D printed parts can also be useful for personal projects as well, as things like art projects, chess pieces, and cups! Being able to look into printing prosthetics for children will be an interesting and helpful experience for many members of the community who wish to help support a cause in this small way.
",,"
The founding members will be the leaders for the first year. At the end of the first year, Leaders will be chosen by rank-choice voting, with the previous year's leaders' votes counting three times. Knowledge and skill will hopefully be selected for in the voting, but extra training will be provided to the new leaders before the end of the year. The leaders will be expected to set meetings, train new members, and maintain the printers. 
Members can join at any time of the year. The club reserves the right to remove members or leaders if they are not acting in accordance with club rules and expectations. Members can be removed if the leaders reach a consensus. Leaders will be removed by Impeachment. 
Impeachment of the leadership will need a 3/4 majority vote. If an impeachment vote fails, at least two weeks must elapse before it can be brought up again. If a vote passes, the leaders must step down (unless the club leaders can land a bottle flip first try, in which case they will be totally exonerated) and open election will take place. 
","This club is unique in that it will allow people to use the 3D printers without the commitment required by clubs like Science Olympiad and Robotics. Also, we will provide assistance for people struggling with engineering and design classes in terms of CAD help. Also, this is the only club at Stuyvesant that will explicitly teach how to maintain a 3D printer. This club is unique in that it will allow people to ask us to make things and we can do it for free.

During meetings, we'll explore different careers in medicine, from internal medicine to dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, research, and more. Meetings will generally be centered around a pre-recorded shadowing session with a health professional (e.g. MD, Ph.D., DDS, EMT, PA), and as a group, we will take a look at what a career in a respective field is like. We will also break down case studies (often with associated imaging and lab values) by taking a look at the anatomical and physiological aspects of the study and any other related biological concepts. We will also analyze the patient's history (complaints, past medical disorders, etc.) as well as any provided imaging (MRI scans, CT scans, X-rays, etc.) and test results (i.e. lab values) that are available. The club will also support members who are interested in medicine/biology through lessons associated with the case studies. ","The Pre-Health Shadowing Club is an opportunity for anyone that might be in any way interested in pursuing a career in health, and it is also a way to share your interests and passion with the rest of the club. Members will be able to hear stories and opinions from real health professionals about what a day in the life of a medical professional in a certain medical field is like. We will also have lessons on different biological concepts to develop a background before we take a deep dive into real case studies presented by various health professionals. Such supplemental lessons will help foster members’ interest in medicine/biology, acting as a means of both absorbing new information and reinforcing previously-learned concepts that build upon focal ideas present in case studies covered in our meetings. Through extensive analysis of individual case studies, members will gain a better understanding of how to approach a case study and will be able to develop critical problem-solving skills involved in interpreting such case studies and the relevant biology behind them. Additionally, since the club offers the opportunity for members to hear from health professionals about their careers and experiences, members will gain a better understanding of what a career in health really looks like and if such a career is something that sparks their interest. ",,"Appointment and impeachment are to be decided by a consensus among board members. Any members interested in joining the board will be given an interview along with prepared questions (likely as a Google form) from the current board. We mainly want to get to know the candidates through the interview process and questionnaire. Ultimately, factors such as attendance, dedication, contribution, enthusiasm, and leadership ability will play a role in the appointment procedure. Appointment interviews will take place at the beginning of the semester/school year given, of course, that there are vacant positions on the board that need to be filled. Impeachment will be considered based on board members’ behavior and any rising concerns within the club. Board members are expected to maintain good attendance, participation, and responsibility with respect to their roles in the club (i.e. the head of communications would be expected to notify members of upcoming meetings and to encourage attendance/participation). If a member falls short of upholding their responsibilities in the club, a discussion/vote will be held among board members for possible impeachment. ","This club is a chapter of a larger virtual Pre-Health Shadowing Program that spans different schools. Through the Pre-Health Shadowing program, the club has access to over 100 virtual shadowing sessions with real health professionals. The club at Stuyvesant serves as an opportunity for those possibly interested in a health profession to learn more about possible careers. Additionally, the club offers a supportive learning opportunity as we analyze case studies (which can otherwise be dense with medical jargon and new concepts). With this club, we hope to encourage those interested in a career in medicine/research by offering a convenient and engaging place to learn about medicine.

In this club, the very first thing we will do is research mushroom species, what conditions each species needs, and then vote on which ones to grow. Next, we plan on planting the mushroom spawn and helping it thrive until we can fully harvest it. After which, we will cook it (most likely stir-fry). Members aren't required to cook it nor eat it but it is highly recommended. By tasting the fruits of your labor, you can further enrich a passion for Fungi. Join us if you are interested in anything fungi or farming related. Even if you are not, you can at least enjoy a free meal. This club is low commitment and open to anyone with any level of experience. As long as you are excited to learn more, you are welcome to come. ","There are a multitude of reasons this benefits the Stuyvesant community. A few of which are this club will teach students a sense of responsibility through nurturing mushrooms and uniqueness of Fungi. For example, Certain mushrooms only grow under certain conditions and require specific care. Students will be responsible for watering the mushrooms; checking if the humidity and temperature of the room is perfect; seeing how well the Fungi has progressed; and being poignant with harvesting time because a day too late could lead to a poor harvest. Also, Fungi are generally disregarded in the school curriculum. In biology, we have full units in which we learn all about muscle fibers in animals and photosynthesis in Plants but skip over Fungi. Most people do not even know that Fungi are not plants, they are their own separate kingdom of life. In this club, we will talk more thoroughly about the importance of Fungi such their effects on the ecosystem which goes more in detail than the ""Fungi are decomposers"" fact we learned in bio. Even if this club does not put ""Fungi"" into Stuyvesant students' daily topics of conversation, we hope that at the very least, Fungi are more widely talked about.",https://discord.gg/wpceqepa56,"This club will have 2 people in power: a president and vice president. At the end of the school year, the club will hold an election. The person who received the most votes will become president and the second highest will become vice president. If there is a tie, the candidates who tied will choose between themselves or another election will be held between two of them. There will also be team captains that each oversee a certain mushroom if the club is growing more than 1 species at a time. The president and vice president will elect the team captains. After which, the team captains will choose their team members. When new positions of power are elected, discord admin roles will be moved and the ownership of the club will be given to the newly elected president. For impeachment to happen, a majority of the members must vote in approval of the impeachment. Impeached members can not run again. ","This club is going to be completely unique to Stuyvesant because Stuyvesant has never had a fungi club before. Also, it is going to be really fun. The gardening work is usually going to be very light so most of the time will be spent on chilling out and talking about Fungi. After harvesting, we are going to cook and have a great time eating. We might even have guest speakers who will come and talk about Fungiculture.

At the beginning of the school year, students will have the opportunity to explore different divisions of FBLA through student-led workshops on each topic. As competition season arrives, members will choose a few divisions to focus on where they will work with other members with similar interests to improve at their chosen skill. Our club will help create teams or groups for members who wish to compete in team divisions and provide opportunities to attend conferences with other talented high school students from all across the country. As students are preparing for FBLA competitions, they are also able to learn important business skills that will help them in the future and meet people with similar interests as them.","Stuy FBLA allows students to participate in events offered by the organization FBLA, which “helps high school students prepare for careers in business through academic competitions, leadership development, and educational programs.” The organization is focused on giving students a taste of what it is like to work in the business sector as an adult. This club can educate the Stuyvesant community about important business related skills that can also be helpful in daily life. FBLA hopes to give students exposure to multiple career pathways so that they can be prepared for the future. Students also have the opportunity to gain experience in business careers through provided resources and can learn to appreciate the importance of understanding business. Furthermore, Stuy FBLA helps its members to distinguish themselves from their peers by immersing them in a competitive environment where they can demonstrate their abilities. By joining this club, students will learn and develop skills that will aid them in their careers and lives, such as leadership, money management, personal finance, and more. FBLA is a great resource for high school students interested in learning business concepts, and it is one of the few ways they can gain experience as most internships and other opportunities are exclusively available to those who already have experience. Stuy FBLA has no prior experience requirements, so it is the perfect place for students with any amount of previous knowledge to develop their interest in business and demonstrate their passions through competitions and leadership.
",https://linktr.ee/stuyfbla,"Stuy FBLA’s leadership structure includes a President who oversees the club and manages FBLA conferences, along with a Vice-President to help them run the club. Staff positions include: Event Organizer, Head of Publicity, Social Media Manager, Budgeting Director, Secretary, IT Director, Reporter, and Mentors. At the end of every year, the President opens applications for these staff positions, which will include a Google Form component and an interview. The President, Vice President, and Head of Publicity meet to rate each applicant according to a rating sheet. They will consider applicants and choose the ones they think are best suited to the position based on their activity at meetings and competitions. The candidate that receives the most votes for each position becomes staff. A special case is made for the President; if the Vice-President remains in the club after the President leaves, they will automatically assume the position. If they graduate in the same year, the existing staff will elect the new President, and the President will choose their new Vice-President.
Impeachment of any staff member works through a submission by any member of the club to the advisor, which must include a valid and specific reason. They will call all staff together to organize a club-wide vote on the possible impeachment. If more than ⅔ of the club’s members agree to impeach the leader, they will be removed from their position and replacement will occur as if they had graduated. If more than ½ of the club’s members agree to impeach the leader, they will be given a warning. If the staff member in question accumulates three warnings, they are automatically impeached.
","Stuy FBLA is the official Stuyvesant chapter of the organization Future Business Leaders of America. It is the only platform for interested Stuyvesant students to practice for and compete in FBLA and participate in their various events. In addition, Stuy FBLA helps to prepare students to be successful in FBLA competitions and future business endeavors. The skills learned here will help students gain experience to prepare for future company management positions and tackle the struggles of daily life as an adult. Participating in FBLA shows colleges and companies that the student is passionate and experienced in business topics, making them seem like a better candidate for internships and other opportunities.
","Meetings are usually held on Thursdays or occasionally Fridays. At the beginning of each month, a meeting will be held which goes over the events of the month and offers reminders on individual work. There will also be two workshops in which students can hone their skills in a specific area. More meetings may be held each month for a special occasion. Members should also be available on the day of the district conference, which will be released early in the season.

Expectations for members: - Dedicated, active club members are the essential element in the success of any club. A Club Member… - Attends meetings and events regularly; no one has the right to “grumble” if not in attendance. - Communicates. Stand up and make your voice heard; reply to surveys, vote. More than one club has been saved from an unwise decision by the voice of one individual. - Encourages others. Don’t be a wet blanket, “a person or thing that quenches or dampens enthusiasm, pleasure or the like.” - Fulfills the duties of membership, which include encouraging friends or associates to join each year to sustain the club for future generations. Be willing to fulfill responsibilities as well as exercise rights. - Gives credit where credit is due. Don’t be a “credit grabber” - one who is always first in line when it comes to taking a bow, but nowhere to be seen in the midst of responsibility. - Don’t hesitate to praise fellow members for a job well done. - Keeps a sense of humor. Don’t take yourself too seriously or others not seriously enough. - •Is personally involved. Try to inject a warm, personal note in club work. Blend gentleness with firmness when taking a stand. - Keeps the purpose of the club in mind. If certain goals or methods appear to be outmoded, take the necessary steps to update them. - Preserves amidst shortcomings and difficulties. Expect frustration and difficulty when dealing with people. Be ready to try again and again. Willingness to continue will benefit everyone. - Conserves club’s financial resources. Keep expenses under control. Many worthwhile clubs have disbanded because of waste or mismanagement of funds. - Prepares for each meeting. Be prepared for meetings, a lack of preparation is one of the main reasons for unproductive meetings. - Promotes a spirit of teamwork. Don’t let your club be crippled by a membership that splinters into uncooperative or hostile cliques. - Resolves differences. Be a peacemaker – when misunderstandings, disputes and clashes arise, help to clear the air by trying to reach a peaceful accord.","Culture has the potential to improve sustainability, connect people, reduce environmental challenges, create novel professions that specialize in culture, and even largely impact the economy. Our goal is to educate members about culture so that they can go out and impact the world in such ways. We believe in the importance of equipping this generation to be those that inspire good changes in the world. We also understand that within our classes in school we aren't often educated about cultures and may not see ourselves represented in history. Therefore, this club is a way where we can get that exposure. Aside from the benefits on the larger world, the CCPR Initiative creates an environment where club members feel respected and safe to learn and participate. This is something that our members can take into their Stuy classes. We help develop a place where we all can develop a sense of pride and self-esteem. The CCPR initiative also prepares us to be prepared for the world outside of our school environment because we are better prepared to be a part of diverse workplaces and communities. Learning about cultures other than our own helps us become more empathetic, more open-minded to others' ideas, and more willing to accept and love others.

If the issue cannot be resolved we may remove them from the position - We will bring the issue to the school union and administrators if need be. - We will have a further discussion with them and about the behavior - Everyone will have an input about the decision in a final vote - we will then decide on whether we should appoint someone new or wait to decide

The club will meet bi-weekly (twice a month) to talk, share and eat! All students who attend will be expected to bring in any type of home-made baked good to share with the members. They will also be expected to provide a list of all the ingredients in the confection. Coming in they must be prepared to answer questions on what it is as well as their process while making it. Eating utensils, plates, and napkins will be provided along with bags and boxes so that extra food can be taken and shared with family or other friends. Members will be expected to exchange their personal and/or favorite recipes, baking websites, and utensils. Together, they will also exchange knowledge on certain techniques and help each other improve upon their recipes and skills. If you have dietary restrictions you will also be responsible for informing the rest of the members, and ensuring you can consume what they've made. ","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community because it encourages an environment where bakers can socialize not only with words but with their food as well. Often times bakers will have too many recipes to try and not enough time, with the baking club members will be able to try new recipes and decide whether it is worth recreating. It's a place where you can meet new people and make new friends who you know share the same interest, eliminating the anxiety when bringing up new topics around people. The baking club is a place of relaxation as not only do members get to snack and chat, they will also have the gratification of seeing others enjoy what they made. The activity serves as a place of support, motivation, and learning, allowing students to draw information from another member's experience to further improve upon their own skills. Ideas given from another student will help unleash their creativity and encourage experimentation with different ingredients.

Leaders will be removed if they do not attend a meeting properly prepared, or fail to show up without giving a reason as to why. Impolite conduct will also lead to impeachment. Additionally, if the club feels another member would be better suited for the role, they can request a change where a majority vote would be taken. If a member in a leadership position graduates, leaves, or steps down a vote will be held for the positions or positions taking into account the criteria listed above. ","It is Stuyvesants only baking centered club allowing members to communicate through the food they made when words don't feel like enough. The aspect of eating everyone's baked goods knowing they made it from scratch brings about a sense of personal connection. The carefree nature of the club allows members to explore a non-academic hobby with others. It serves not just as a group of people but as a big melting pot for food and ideas to flow.

Stuyvesant Literary Identities,literaryidentities,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/literaryidentities/a5bc5eba,Literary Identities is a welcoming club dedicated to reading queer books and discussing media through a queer lens. ,"Literary Identities will unite Stuyvesant students through a shared love of literature in all mediums and encourage critical thinking skills through reading. The role of queerness in literature is often rarely discussed and heavily underrepresented in society. We aim to ensure that students will have the opportunity to explore both familiar and unfamiliar literature through a different lens and discuss ideas including queer themes, queer representation (or lack thereof), and more. Literary Identities will also focus on reducing stigma that surrounds LGBTQ+ issues and aim to discuss harmful queer tropes. Each month, we will read and focus on a new book in our meetings, which will be chosen by popular vote, as well as analyze a new theme in each meeting. The club will also occasionally host other events like discussion meetings on a specific topic or movie nights with queer shows or movies (we may or may not bring snacks!). ","Our club will benefit the Stuyvesant community by providing a safe space for queer students and allies, as well as developing a sense of community for them. Members will be able to have fun and make friends through a shared love of reading. Our club aims to introduce new literature that is seldom taught in classes and not included in standard curricula—in other words, literature that spotlight or highlight queer identities that, due to their subject of “taboo” topics, subsequently receive less exposure. These clubs are especially important in this climate since legislation like the “Don’t Say Gay'' bill was passed, limiting the normalization of the LGBTQ+ community. Consider how often a student actually reads queer books or even books with queer characters that are not riddled with harmful tropes. Our club will host discussions on these important topics and others like the development of character identities and other socially stigmatized ideas. We will also discuss other forms of literature, which are not often explored in academia and even literature originating from other countries. This introduces Stuyvesant students to new voices and perspectives and, in turn, allows them to explore new ideas that they may not have considered otherwise. And we promote reading (and education)!",Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stuyliteraryidentities/ Discord: https://discord.gg/WZBjDdEeQ5,"There will be three presidents and two or three vice presidents who lead the club, oversee club operations, maintain contact with the school administration and the rest of the council, as well as create and teach lessons. This makes up the cabinet. The presidents are responsible for managing club activities, as well as communicating coherently to the rest of the club. The vice presidents design slides or other materials to present to the club, manage administrative tasks, and lead discussions. The presidents will hold applications for cabinet on a rolling basis when positions are available. Cabinet member(s) can be impeached if a two-thirds majority of the club and a simple majority of the cabinet vote for impeachment when cabinet member(s) fail to uphold proper conduct. Members of the club are expected to remain in good standing with the school and attend at least one meeting. Everyone is expected to follow the rules of StuyActivities. ","Literary Identities will focus specifically on queer literature and queer readings of literature. Most book choices will not necessarily be “mainstream” books and will instead, often highlight less well-known authors. Even so, we will also review popular books and analyze them through a queer-centric lens. Members can come to view media differently and examine common tropes that have come to represent queerness in broader society. Above all, we wish to create a club that encourages discussion around these topics and welcomes everyone.

Financial Analysis Club,financialanalysis,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/financialanalysis/0881b4d5,Introduce members to the world of financial analysis. ,"The Stuyvesant Financial Analysis Club aims to introduce Stuyvesant students to the world of financial analysis and help prepare them for future professional opportunities in the field. At first, the meetings will cover the fundamentals of accounting in order for members to understand numbers that will be crucial to evaluate companies of business. Some of the documents that members will learn how to analyze are the income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flow, and statement of shareholder’s equity. Later on, the club will shift focus to financial analysis, where members will learn about evaluating companies' present performance and future potential with the use of both fundamental and technical analysis. The club will be split into two departments, one focused on using fundamental analysis to evaluate companies, while the other will be focused on using technical analysis. Members of the fundamental analysis department will learn to use financial statements to determine a business’s value. With the use of macroeconomic and financial data, they will learn to come up with an intrinsic value for a company and decide whether it is overvalued or undervalued. Members of the technical analysis department will learn to use trading activity, potential patterns, and market sentiment to predict the future of a company. By creating different departments, the club leaders aim to help students find the type of financial analysis that they are most interested in. Leaders expect that members show up to almost all of our meetings, participate in activities, finish their assignments/presentations on time and be willing to learn.","The Stuyvesant Financial Analysis club will benefit the Stuyvesant community in numerous ways. One way it will do so is by allowing students to explore an area of finance not found in any other club in the school. Students will be able to get a grasp on the fundamentals of finance and accounting through the general club meetings, but will also learn more specific career-based knowledge later in the year. They will focus on mastering what interests them most about financial analysis and developing crucial skills that will help them later in their professional life. In the club, there will be a heavy focus on presentation and public speaking skills, which are bound to help students in many future careers, especially business or finance related ones. Additionally, students will grow their time management and teamwork skills, as they will work in teams and will have to meet strict deadlines. Students can also use the skills that they learn within our club for their own benefit. Students could use their knowledge to invest in different companies or to run their own companies. The club will aid students in choosing a career path and becoming well versed in it, but will also develop crucial life skills that will be useful tools throughout their lives. 
",https://www.instagram.com/stuy.fac/,"There will be six leadership positions: President, 2 Vice Presidents, Head of Technical Analysis, Head of Fundamental Analysis, and Social Media Manager. The current vice presidents will elect the future vice presidents(before they graduate) and the current president will elect the future president(before they graduate). The head of technical analysis, the head of fundamental analysis, and the social media manager will be chosen from an application process consisting of a written portion and an interview. The president and vice presidents will decide on the best candidate for each position. The head of technical analysis, the head of fundamental analysis, and the social media manager have to re-apply if they wish to hold the same position the next year.

The Venturer was founded to make business knowledge more accessible to high school students, and we hope to do so by breaking down information in a digestible format. Our club lessons are targeted toward all audiences and are designed to remain informative for students with varying levels of business knowledge. Alongside regular lectures, the club connects students passionate about business and provides a platform for them to write and publish business research reports of their choice. Writers also have the option to pursue more investigative topics such as corporate strategies, marketing and growth techniques, and execution plans that bring companies success. Through a combination of our lessons and hands-on activities, prospective business students will improve their financial literacy, business management skills, awareness of sustainable business practices, and confidence in the investment of stocks/cryptocurrency. Within the club, we hope to cultivate a community of like-minded students interested in the intersection of business and writing. On a broader scope, despite whether or not club members go on to pursue business careers in the future, we hope that all active participants will be equipped with the skills necessary to make informed financial decisions in the future.","The Stuyvesant Venturer serves as a place for students to learn and write about the world of business while providing an outlet for them to have their work published. Meetings begin with a finance-related lesson and conclude with designated time for researching relevant business news for meeting reports. These reports will allow writers to develop strong research and business writing skills, which are crucial for communicating ideas in the corporate world, such as in financial analysis and product management. The club will also host speaker panels, case studies, and consulting competitions, allowing students to discover the intricacies of the business field while providing them with first-hand experiences that allow them to apply what they learn. Through speaker series with business experts, members will have the opportunity to gain insight into the professional world of business and ask speakers about their career paths and experiences. Additionally, by participating in Venturer case studies and competitions, students will learn how to provide a product pitch, decide if a company is worth investing in, and pose a potential consulting presentation detailing their findings. Active members will be selected to participate in out-of-school competitions, usually in teams of four. Teams will receive guidance from the leadership board, which has experience competing and winning in investment competitions.",https://www.instagram.com/stuyventurer/,"The Stuyvesant Venturer has a president and three executives on the leadership board. The president hosts club meetings, oversees the writing and publication process, and manages the appointment of the Chief of Operations, Director of Public Relations, and Director of Web Development. The Chief of Operations manages administrative affairs and facilitates the procedures of the club; the Director of Public Relations is responsible for public outreach, collaborations with other clubs, and social media accounts; and the Director of Web Development maintains the website and formats articles on the site. All members of the executive board are responsible for planning meeting activities, editing group reports/articles, providing suggestions to writers, and reviewing executive board applications. Presidents are chosen by the current executive board after applicants submit a written application and complete an interview. Applicants must have been active members of the club for at least six months and, ideally, would have written at least one report/article. If an executive neglects their responsibilities, they will be issued a warning; upon further misconduct, the rest of the executive board will discuss the issue and vote on whether or not the executive should be removed from their position.","Stuyvesant has a plethora of STEM clubs, whereas opportunities for students to explore the business field are much sparser. In addition, though the few existing business clubs teach about finances through presentations, they don’t provide members the ability to explore specific topics that interest them. The Stuyvesant Venturer engages students in producing content they’re passionate about while preparing them for future business careers. Rather than simply attending lectures, members learn from group collaboration and research, which improves their understanding and retention of what they learn. Executives are still there to guide and mentor writers, but members are the driving force behind the business paths in which they choose to delve into.","Meetings are typically held every two weeks, but meeting days are flexible and depend on member availability. Each meeting consists of a finance-related lesson, followed by designated time for researching relevant business news for meeting reports/articles. Articles are uploaded to the club folder, converted to a one-pager, and potentially posted on our Instagram spotlights. In place of a normal lesson, the club may occasionally host speaker panels, case studies, and/or consulting competitions.","['friday', 'tuesday', 'monday']",medium,"['business', 'finance', 'economics']","The Venturer is designed to help you tackle the larger learning gap and intimidation factor that comes with the umbrella term of business. If you’re unsure where to start in your journey to becoming financially literate, or perhaps you recently decided that you wanted to pursue a career in the business industry, The Venturer will help guide you on your journey to achieve those goals.

This club is meant to help our members flourish and expand their artistic skills while also being easygoing so our members have time to de-stress and loosen up.","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant community by allowing members to expand their artistic capabilities through creating and learning about jewelry. Making jewelry is perfect for self-expression and communicating thoughts and feelings. We can also help our members cope with stress and feel more refreshed since arts help soothe the mind. Arts and crafts have many benefits and can help improve productivity, organization, planning and patience. While de-stressing during club meetings, members can also get to know each other and create bright and encouraging friendships. Since all members will have common interests, they will have the opportunity to teach each other what they know about jewelry and share a common goal. We can also create jewelry based on upcoming events or holidays (Valentine’s day, etc.).

Girls Wrestling Club,girlswrestling,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/girlswrestling/0dd67859,The Girls Wrestling Club is meant to empower young women through the art of wrestling since Stuy currently doesn't have a girls' wrestling team.,"This club aims to empower young women through the amazing art of wrestling! There will be weekly practices where girls can get together on the mat and learn how to wrestle. This is an amazing opportunity to learn a new skill while surrounded by an encouraging community. No experience required! At each practice, members will help set up, clean the mats, etc. This club will be composed of new and experienced wrestlers, built around a safe and organized environment. An experienced coach will come in to teach students and we will eventually prepare to attend tournaments as a club/team. This club is a great opportunity to try out a new sport, exercise, and get stronger. Stuyvesant currently does not have a girls wrestling team, so if you want to try it out, learn some new skills, or if you're a returning wrestler from the co-ed team in the winter, then this club is for you!","This club will empower the girls in the Stuyvesant community, as well as set an example for the rest of the community. Oftentimes, girls back out of joining the Co-ed Boys Wrestling team in the winter all due to the faulty stigma around wrestling boys. This club has neither of those pressures, so those who chickened out of joining wrestling in the winter may feel more comfortable trying it out in the spring. Wrestling will help students gain confidence, discipline, and respect for themselves. It will provide a much-needed opportunity to girls in stuy, to learn a combat sport. Stuyvesant does not have any other club much like this one. Wrestling (being the only physical combat sport) in Psal, is a relatively safe and organized sport. Psal doesn't currently allow Stuyvesant to create a girls wrestling team, so this club will prove just how much interest girls wrestling in Stuyvesant truly has. In addition, it is important to stand up to gender discrimination and unfairness that this situation creates. This club will serve as a message to create positive change in one's community and fight for equal rights. Other schools have girls wrestling teams, and Stuyvesant has a boys wrestling team, so why not a girls? Young women deserve to have the opportunity to empower and improve themselves.",,"The current leadership positions will be captains and co-captains. Captains will be selected on their leadership skills, their year in Stuy, their compassion, and their skill/experience in wrestling. Co-captains will be selected based on potential, leadership skills, their year in Stuy, their compassion, and their skill/experience in wrestling. Leaders are expected to be encouraging open to educating new members about wrestling. Members are expected to show up to practices and try their hardest to learn and improve while there. If absent, they should have a valid excuse and tell the captains beforehand. While at practice, members should be welcoming to each other and open to learn and help their peers. Between school years, the coach and the captains will collectively decide on next year's captains, and so on. If leaders miss too many practices or don't show enough initiative, then their positions will be revoked. Three strikes will be given before their position is revoked. ","This club is unique because Stuyvesant doesn't have any other physical combat sports that target the female population. No other club will have mats laid out or an actual coach to help teach a PSAL sport. In all of Stuy's past years, PSAL has never allowed a girls wrestling team, which many students deem highly unfair. This club both serves as a fun new experience and a deep message. We are working to prove PSAL wrong.

We offer a warm community and easy-to-access resources that allows people to come together to discuss and learn more about the recent breakthroughs of the AI industry, and how we can utilize the power of AI, as well as a way to stay updated on their development. Meetings will be held at least once a week, either in-person or on the club Discord server, where members can get quick updates on A.I.

Firstly, the club itself acts as an interest hotspot, as we run a Discord server online. This allows for not only Stuy students, but people from around the world to join in and share their opinions on current discussions, and this grants an opportunity for an expansion beyond Stuyvesant and creates further connections for the community. To add on, the staff team will occasionally reach out to guest speakers, interns, and scholars from the A.I. industry and invite them to host seminars and share their knowledge and experiences for the members of the club, and this allows for our community to have access to legitimate information. Furthermore, it creates an opportunity for Stuyvesant and its community to become a leading organization in this new industry that will undoubtedly grow to dominate the world one day.

These individuals are highly-committed members of the club that have shown dedication and are trusted to help with the hosting of meetings and the moderation of events, as well as running the Discord Server.

These people are granted distinction either because of their expertise in the field of computer science and A.I., or because they show exceptional dedication to the club. Honorary members can also consist of scholars and alumni from outside the school, who have been invited to share their knowledge for members. As stated before, this club aims to offer a community of enthusiasts to all high school students, so this allows for people outside of Stuyvesant to join in. After this, there’s the “Vice-presidents”. These individuals are selected by the President to help run and manage the entirety of the club. They are ones who can be selected for the transfer of leadership. Lastly, the “president” is the leader of the club, and he/she is expected to run the club smartly and efficiently. The president is expected to host meetings, manage the Discord server, and search for opportunities for the club. When the president is attending his/her last year at Stuyvesant, a meeting will be held between the president and the vice-presidents on deciding who will be the next president. It is required for the president to select a vice-president that is at least one grade-year younger than him/her, so allows for a certainty for leadership transfer. The vice-president role can be removed based on the president’s decision, and the president’s role can be removed based on the decision of the entire club. If the majority of the club agrees that the president isn’t doing his job to meet the expectations, they can cast a vote to impeach the current president.

Stuyvesant Art Immersion Project,artimmersionproject,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/artimmersionproject/eee602d5,"To bring artists in fields spanning cultures to Stuyvesant, with a focus on those that are obscure or misunderstood.
","In the ethnically diverse community of Stuyvesant, and of New York City, it is time to embrace the art forms that may seem “out of the box.” The Stuyvesant Art Immersion Project wants to break boundaries in terms of who likes what, transgressing typical norms or tendencies. We plan to recognize and explore more mainstream art forms as well, but using a variety of perspectives and focusing on their backgrounds. The central goal is to dissipate ignorance and provide a greater nuance to the arts we present. To achieve this most effectively, we aim to let those who are most inspired by these arts tell their stories, as well as the story of the art form - real artists. This club will organize monthly lecture-demonstrations, each time featuring a different artist(s) and art form. In order to portray as complete a picture as possible, artist presentations will adopt a half explanatory, half demonstration format. The lecture portion of the session presents the historical and current significance of the art form, and the demonstration portion exclusively showcases the art. The artistic unknown often has a significant historical context and rich culture associated with it. To experience unique arts and understand their power are universal learning experiences, and, further, taking inspiration from different modes of expression is a life-long tool. Featured art styles would include, but not be limited to, live dance, music, visual arts, and multimedia.","Historically, Stuyvesant has been known for academic rigor and academic opportunities that benefit the students that attend the school. We want to build on these fundamental ideas of a Stuyvesant education. Rather than stop at academic excellence, the project will add inspiration from art and self-expression through art as skills students can use for the rest of their lives. Its core values of unconventionality and open-minded thinking are key to an artistic education, and access to “out of the box” demonstrations allow students to choose and remember what resonates with them. To do this, the club will have to break the barriers that hold students back from exposure to arts and culture: the lack of accessible art demonstrations, as a result of factors such as cost or location. We will coordinate an effort to bring the most credited guest speakers and engaging, well curated presentations of their respective art to Stuyvesant for free. In our efforts, this club will promote an attitude of self-advocacy and reject quantification of artistic realization. This does not only apply to club members, but represents the concept we want to bring to the entire student body. To access the whole school, the personal connections club members have to the arts are vital. We hope to build a diverse network of students, and thus bring a diverse set of artists to Stuyvesant. This club will present an opportunity to both share art and to break preconceived notions about various art forms. Again, artistic immersion begins with learning and exploring the unknown.",,"The club will be structured more like a community project and less like a discussion group. This is because the club exists to work towards events that will be open to all Stuyvesant students (and faculty), not just club members. Positions for secondary leaders will be strategically designed by the president and vice-president so that the club can most effectively orchestrate artist demonstrations and carry out associated work. Major sectors of work are artist outreach and coordination with school administration. Seeing as the administrative function of the club is integral to its impact within the Stuyvesant community, selecting impactful leaders in all facets of the club’s operation is essential. Those who wish to be considered for administrative positions must be passionate, hardworking, open to learning, and demonstrate their commitment towards the club’s goals. Monthly feedback forms will be sent out, including a space to report a strike against a leader if they are not completing their duties. Three strikes, and the agreement of sixty-five percent of club members will result in impeachment. When the positions of president and vice-president become available, members will participate in choosing suitable replacements. We will prioritize the continued existence of the club and its practices for years to come when electing new leaders. ","The Stuyvesant Art Immersion Project will implement a community project unlike any previous effort at Stuyvesant. Its mission is to add depth to the learning experience at Stuyvesant, and simultaneously promote a fuller understanding of the arts we spotlight. In order to achieve transformation in these areas, this club aims big. We target the entire Stuyvesant community, and we utilize outreach and collaboration with the most credited external sources. We believe that learning from art and its power are transformative experiences for all students, and aim to unite students with passion for the arts. And because it is understanding that we are after, maintaining the integrity of the art forms we bring to Stuyvesant is very important to us. We want to paint the full picture. Unlike other clubs at Stuyvesant that focus on sharing art through the lens of culture, we want to learn about cultural context through the lens of art. We intentionally use this approach, with the goal that nuances other than culture will be illuminated. In addition, our program structure intentionally uses spoken lectures and actual demonstrations in conjunction so that students can understand the context of the art form, then view it firsthand, hopefully with a new perspective or a more stimulated mind. ",To be determined based on the availability of club members. There will be a monthly guest presentation. ,"['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday']",medium,"['culture', 'art', 'performance']","We encourage recommendations for potential art forms, organizations, or demonstration styles.

Stuyvesant Reform Club,stuyreformclub,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyreformclub/459b0482,The Stuyvesant Reform Club aims to educate students in political theory and encourage students to experiment with policy and civic reform.,"The Stuyvesant Reform Club is intended to educate students on the theory of government, the various forms of government practiced around the world, and how different systems and techniques of government can be applied to solve issues of the political system. It will educate students on major political issues surrounding the government and the causes and effects of these issues, as well as potential solutions to these problems which will help create a more well-functioning government. Members will be expected to partake in orderly and well-researched discussions of ideas and concepts, draft organized and well-conceived proposals for reforms, and offer fair and justified criticism of others' ideas in order to help the club arrive at a consensus for reform proposals. Members will be expected to remain civil, not allow partisan biases to cloud reason and debate, and to respect all ideas for reform of the United States Government to promote good governance.","This activity will primarily benefit Stuyvesant by increasing awareness of the importance and significance of the design of government, the principles by which it should be organized, and how the modern US government can be improved. This activity will also allow students to gain an understanding of how politics and government is conducted in other countries, as well as how differences in government and institutions can produce varying results for nations. By instilling a strong understanding of institutions, their design, and their importance in the continuation of the Republic, the Stuyvesant Reform Club will not only prepare students to engage with government actively, but also to be architects of government in their own right, an essential skill in today's world where reforms are clearly needed.

This activity, by its nonpartisan and government-focused nature, will also teach students to respect each others' opinions and enrich the political scene at Stuyvesant by not just having students discuss the ideas of others, but also to produce their own original ideas and debate them in a civil manner before creating proposals which could be put into place in the real world such as ballot measures or other model legislation. Such activities will enrich the Stuyvesant Community.",,"The club will be organized by an Organizing Committee and a Secretary-Moderator. There will be no Club President or similar. The Organizing Committee shall consist of 5 students initially, with this number subject to change from year-to-year based on the discretion of the current organizing committee, with all membership size changes taking effect in the following election for Organizing Committee (OC). 

The OC will be elected every year at a time determined by the OC, and shall be elected through simple approval voting. The OC will be responsible for organizing and scheduling meetings and activities, conducting dialogue with the SU and school administration, and generally conducting the business necessary to sustain the functioning of the club. The OC will also appoint a Secretary-Moderator from the general membership every year. 

The role of the Secretary-Moderator is to ensure debates remain civil, to take minutes, and to ensure the smooth running of club meetings. 

The Secretary-Moderator and the OC may be removed from office at any time if proof of misconduct or abuse of power is brought forth by a member of the club, and a majority of the club votes to remove the offending club official. At that point, an immediate replacement election for an OC member, or a replacement pick for the Secretary-Moderator is conducted.","Our organization is unique because it encourages students to think critically not just about politics from an electoral standpoint or a procedural one, but from a perspective of using power to solve problems. The Reform Club will thus be a nonpartisan and purely policymaking-focused club. We encourage students to think of how government can be used to improve the lives of people, and also how government itself can be improved to better serve the general welfare. The club will encourage students not just to paraphrase politicians, but to come up with their own genuine ideas for reform and policy, and to debate them civilly. They shall be student legislators. Not student partisans. Not student debaters. Student legislators, who shall focus on fixing problems, not rooting for a political party or trying to ""win"" a debate.","Our meeting schedule will vary throughout the year, but generally be every 2 days.

","All members of this club would follow a curriculum of handouts and online courses (Edx, Khan Academy, Saylor Academy, etc....) in order to promote a general understanding of business, economics, and trading. Everyone would be required to keep up with the material as we would discuss the real-world applications when we meet. However, unlike other business-based clubs, Stuy B&T would place a special focus on international business and globalization and commit to encouraging interest in the global marketplace. This club would commit to introducing club members to the global marketplace while encouraging a basic understanding of business and trade in the United States. Club members would also be required to compete in national competitions for business and trading in order to produce greater comprehension of the topics studied and to promote team bonding and club recognition. However, most importantly, this should be a club where fellow members connect and learn with each other, and where ideas and fun experiences are shared with one another. 
","All members would walk away from this club with a great understanding of the global marketplace, international business, and trading. They would walk away with experience in national business competitions and hopefully certificates or medals to present. Along with this, the members would have participated in multiple online courses, discovered countless business and trading topics online, and received professional certificates to further their future career and college aspirations. While meeting with fellow club members there would be a sense of community and fellowship where students from all grades would converse and advise each other. This club will bring into existence a place for students interested in the global market, which Stuyvesant as of now, does not have. For many students interested in global affairs, there lacks a space to meet with other students with similar interests which is why this club is a very valuable space. The international market and globalization are very important topics, especially today when trade between countries is so common and only increasing, which is why a club focusing on these topics is much desired by many students across all grades. Especially since Stuy students are so international. Global trade is apparent everywhere in our day-to-day lives however, many don't recognize it until they are taught about it, this club provides that tutoring for these students in order to recognize the international aspects in our lives. 
",https://www.instagram.com/stuybusinessandtrading/ ,"Those that miss three meetings will be kicked from the club unless they give reasons why they couldn't be present and tell the president or vice president ahead of time. These meetings can be made up by receiving great results in competitions entered into, by going above and beyond in the curriculum, and by participating a lot in club discussions. Hopefully, there won't be any impeachments however, those not actively participating in competitions will also have to provide direct reasons and make up for it later by engaging in other competitions. People may be appointed as presidents in training when the President and vice president are in their senior year. This training will include shadowing the president and/or vice president and taking part in some of their activities until the president and vice president leave. They will be chosen by the president or vice president based on achievements, participation in the club, and through academic results in the curriculum. 
","This club would not just focus on learning about the U.S. market but the global marketplace and they would participate in online courses with each other instead of just researching in order to learn the most they can about these topics. Competitions would be a requirement for all members and all meetings would be mandatory except with good excuses. At meetings, there would be in-depth discussions on topics such as globalization where students of all grades can learn from and support each other.
","We will meet every Monday after school, meeting more than that only if we have to. We would most likely do virtual meetings but we would try to organize in-person meeting whether it be in school or out of school at least a month. The meetings would take place from 3:30-5:00.

","American Sign Language is spoken by more than 500,000 people in the United States, but it is not taught as a language course at Stuyvesant. Because of this, StuyASL aims to create an environment where anyone who is interested can come to learn it. StuyASL also hopes to be a place where any Deaf or CODA students can share and discuss their experiences. We also hope to be a place to learn about the history of ASL and other signed languages, as well as about about Deaf culture. In doing these things, we can create a supportive environment where anyone can learn new ASL vocabulary, structure, or grammar and practice their skills with others in the club. StuyASL is a low commitment activity, and we hope to create a low stress environment where students can learn about a topic they are interested in without having to worry about homework or grades. ","ASL is an important and diverse language. StuyASL fulfills the need for a place to learn ASL and about it, seeing as ASL is curently not offered as a language course or elective option at Stuy. Members will create memories and friendships lasting far beyond their time at Stuyvesant by learning to communicate with each other through American Sign Language. Most Stuy students have not had any exposure to any form a sign language, so StuyASL provides an opportunity to learn about a language that is very different from any spoken ones. StuyASL helps students grow empathy and character to by becoming more aware about the issues facing the Deaf community and becoming more familiar with Dead culture. Being culturally aware and able to communicate in new ways is an invaluable skill to succeed in both one’s professional and personal life. Having students who have the skills to learn new languages and forms of communition is beneficial not only to them, but to the Stuyvesant community as well. We want to provide an opportunity for Stuyvesant students to open up and engage with each other about subjects not generally taught at Stuy through a new language where people might be better able to understand themselves and one another.",,"All elections will be held anonymously via google forms. Leaders will be appointed by election in the event that a current leader steps down, graduates, or is impeached. To qualify for election, a member must have attended half of the meetings in the most recent semester, unless they have extenuating circumstances that resulted in their not doing so. Club leaders do not need to be fluent in ASL, but they must be making an active effort to learn. Anyone who has attended a third of meetings in the last semester will be eligible to vote for a new leader. Leaders can be impeached if they are disrespectful towards club members, violate SU or Stuyvesant rules, or are not actively present during most meetings. If concerns are raised about a club leader, club members who have attended a third of meetings in the last semester can vote to impeach. Impeachment of a club leader requires more than 50% of votes in order to be successful. 
","There is currently no club at Stuy dedicated to learning about American Sign Language and does not formally teach ASL to students. The ASL club provides a place where anyone can explore and discover what makes ASL so unique and important to learn. Joining Stuyvesant’s ASL club will provide a strong network and make bonds with other people that will last for many years. The club will teach and educate students in an informal environment, opening space for people to learn ASL and its history at their own pace.

It will look at and focus on the logistics and different strategies/tactics to approach biking. Students will learn many different types and styles of cycling, details and how-tos about each one. As well as the various and different virtues/lessons that can be taken away from the activity of biking. StuyBike will touch upon this sport and/or hobby that many people have and also deeper into it as well just like mentioned. For there is a lot that can be said even about the simple action of maintaining balance and how to properly and efficiently ride a bicycle as well as what it all means overall. Not only that, the club will also look to promote the use of green or environmentally-friendly means of transportation that don't pollute the environment. One of which will of course include the bicycle. This way, students can learn not only about their interest/hobbie of biking but also how they can help using those interests to build a greener and more eco-friendly world that is also helping in solving global warming. Generally, we expect club members to be engaged in their passion and interest as well as the different causes that cycling can represent. Expressing and continuing their enthusiasm about the activity into what we do together as a club as well. It is not expected that everybody shows up all the time for it is understandable that people have different workloads. However, everyone, being in this club, should offer some commitment and contributions to the hobby that they are interested in.","The StuyBike Club aims to connect fellow bicycle lovers in Stuyvesant High School while promoting biking among all fellow schoolmates. On the base level, we hold weekly sessions to discuss biking experiences and plan biking tours from the streets of Manhattan to the rocky terrain of blue mountain. We hope to spread knowledge on biking and also provide an opportunity for club members to meet others who share the same passion. During the meetings, we also try to create reviews on different bikeways. We will post all the content generated on our website to serve fellow bikers. On top of that, we spend time informing others about the benefits of biking, both physically, mentally, and environmentally. By doing so, we hope to spread biking into all parts of our community. Furthermore, we participate in biking marathons like the NYC Five Boro Bike Tour held each year in NYC. These competitions allow members to build a stronger sense of teamwork and persistence. We also host a bike designing competition yearly. During these competitions, participants are asked to design their own bikes. By doing all of these, we hope to promote our members to bike in a more meaningful and joyful way.",https://discord.com/invite/DQQbwMTb,"StuyBike is divided up into 5 main departments, each are operated by a president (which are the founders). While some departments may also have a director who helps out and works with the presidents. The 5 departments are: HOB, PATET, Service, Marketing, and Communications. Firstly, HOB (Hobby of Bicycles) tackles members' growing interest in bicycles and as the name suggests, their hobby of cycling. It will handle tactics and strategies of how to bike sport-wise or just daily biking. Next is PATET (Promoting and Accelerating the Transition to Environmental-friendly Transportation) which will take on the sustainable energy and transport aspect of the club. The club isn't and won't be all about bicycles however, but rather it will be a gateway to exploring the different renewable or non-renewable sources of energy and how we can accelerate the change to sustainable transportation. Then, the Service Department handles the technical aspect of the club, it will tackle the website, the biking map, and the calendar of events, etc. After, there is the Marketing Department which will focus on the spreading of influence in and out of the club, as well as advertising it to the rest of the school. Gaining people's interest in not just the club, but the hobby of bicycles and cycling, as well as environmental-friendly and sustainable transportation. Lastly, is communication, this department focuses on the transfer of information to and from the club's members and the presidents. This could be meeting schedules, events, news, messages, alerts, etc. It also handles the communication with higher authority like adult supervisors and the coordinator of student affairs (COSA). While the club members in the early-club development stage will all be under the HOB and PATET Departments. In mid-club development, the members will all be in the HOB and PATET Departments but some selected few may help in the other departments. Finally, in late-club development, everyone will all be in the HOB and PATET Departments with the other departments now open to positions and help for members to join.

Note: Despite being in other departments, ALL members including the founders & directors will be under the HOB and PATET Departments.

We promote the organization of cycling events to enhance physical and mental health and create a cycling culture in society.","StuyBicycle will typically meet around about 4 times a month as it is medium commitment.

Simply put, sketching can be considered art with a purpose. It involves a creative and systematic plan to visually represent the values and objectives of an individual or organization through symbols, and images. Through workshop lessons and solo/group projects, the club hopes to encourage an environment of problem solving and creativity for its members.
Stuy Sketch also aims to connect Stuy students. We'll be having lessons on sketching but we encourage our members to talk to each other because we hope to create connections beyond just sketching.
Stuy Sketch also provides Stuy students with the materials and environment to sketch. In addition to that we will be helping our members improve on their sketch. Bodies, space, depth, three-dimensionality, and even movement can be made visible through drawing. Furthermore, drawing expresses the draughtsman's personality spontaneously in the flow of the line, making it one of the most personal of all artistic statements.","There is a positive connection between art and mental health—artistic activities such as sculpting, painting, or drawing are known to lower stress levels and promote mental calmness. Creating art takes your mind off of your everyday life and provides a relaxing distraction.
sketching are highly accessible and entertaining things to accomplish many individuals prefer to paint or draw in their spare time, and it can help them improve their IQ. Whether you're an artist or an art lover, sketching and drawing is certainly something that will continue to be important. It helps to stimulate creative thought, increase observational skills and of course, develop visual artwork ideas in all mediums.
Sketching can distract you from the unwanted thoughts associated with anxiety. Anxiety often involves rumination with otherwise known as repetitive looping thoughts. It sometimes seems as if fixating on the same worries can help you find a solution for them.
Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life and career. It also develops hand-eye coordination so that everyday tasks can become easier for you.
Writing is considered to be a type of sketching.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/600658403934967/,"Leadership positions for Stuy Sketch require a fair amount of dedication and interest to the club. Club leaders are expected to handle each meeting prepared with an itinerary of what they hope to teach and what they want their members to take away from. Leaders should prepare any creative design projects for their members to work on and be able to facilitate a discussion or critique. New leaders are appointed at the end of the school year through an application where members will have to fill out a Google form for them to either become the president or vice-president, along with other position

Club members are expected to be present in at least 2 meetings per month. This is to ensure that they will not be missing too many materials from the meetings and will be able to participate in independent or collaborative projects. Members should inform the club leaders if they will be absent prior to the meeting so that leaders can adapt and adjust their meeting plan. 
","Stuy Sketch is a unique club that is for engaging its members in independent or collaborative projects related to elements of sketching, such as shading, color, and shape. By having students participate in these projects like creating their own brand identity or learning how to design their own promotional poster, it allows for members to partake in a unique blend of artistic problem-solving while also sharing their work with the student body. At the end of the year, members will also have the ability to showcase their design work through the club’s annual publication where it will be shown through the club’s website.

Pingminton is an effective way to distract one from their stuy stress. Hitting the birdie with some type of tool can relieve stress and leave one in peace to accomplish more.

Above all else, Stuy Pingminton is a place for students to make many new friends and foster new relationships. Students have been playing Pingminton all over Stuy, and new bonds have been made through playing this vigorous sport. Many people in the past have joined a game or two because of how interesting the sport looks as a spectator. Both watching the game and actually playing have left the player with new friends and a unique memory in their mind. Overall, it's a place for anyone of any skill level to relax and have fun without worrying about a high-commitment and time-consuming club.

Being extremely skillful isn't needed for these roles as this club isn't centered around being really good, but rather just having fun. Later on, as more students join the club, we'll give leadership opportunities to people who are more committed and show up regularly. These roles will come with the responsibility of effectively monitoring people so that we can spread out more and let more people play at the same time. Leaders can give tips to people or even join in and help them improve if they want assistance.","StuyPingminton is as unique as you can get.

If the member is still concerned with the President's leadership, the member should reach out to all club members through the public group chat to start an official vote. All decisions about leadership positions should be communicated with the general group members, and a vote must be held.

Stuy Ren'Py,stuyrenpy,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/stuyrenpy/338c9233,Stuy Ren'Py aims to bring together STEM and creativity through creating visual novels. ,"Members will work in small groups to design visual novel games and upload them onto sites like itch.io for people to play. Visual novels are kind of like Choose Your Own Adventure books, but with much more art and coding. 

Throughout the year, Stuy Ren'Py will host learning meetings, each focused on a different aspect of the game making journey. For example, one meeting may be focused on learning how to draw character sprites while another covers the basics of coding a game user interface. Members are expected to keep regular correspondence with fellow group members and maintain a steady schedule so that the game will be completed in time; leaders of Stuy Ren'Py will check in monthly to ensure that communication progresses smoothly. 

At the end of the year, all of Stuy Ren'Py will gather in a big group ""peanut gallery"" to play each group's finished products. If members wish to, they can upload their games onto itch.io (or other gaming websites) for people outside of the Stuyvesant community to enjoy and leave constructive critique.","Stuy Ren'Py caters to people with all types of interests. For those who like STEM, this club will further their coding ability. Ren'Py, the primary language this club will be using, is also a ""sub"" language under Python, a common coding language that is used in the real world. No matter the occupation a student ultimately decides to go in, Python and algorithmic thinking are valuable skills to know. People who like writing will be able to explore their creativity to the max. Many vsual novels operate on a system of ""paths"" that a player can choose from; depending on their choices, a different ending will be achieved. Writers will really have to stretch their thinking muscles to think of plausible and interesting routes. Artists will be able to go outside of their comfort zone by drawing both people, backgrounds, and objects. They'll also be able to learn character design, a very specific yet important skill for those who aspire to become professional artists in the future. 

The small group system that this club will operate on also gives a great opportunity for people to make close friendships that last beyond high school and receive constructive critique on how to improve their projects.

Overall, this club will benefit the Stuyvesant community by giving students experience with tools used in the professional world and a safe place to make friends and ask for help.",https://www.instagram.com/stuyrenpy/,"There is at least one main president. The person fulfilling this role is expected to be proficient at Ren'Py and be able to provide coding advice to their fellow members. They are also expected to have some experience drawing and writing for visual novels, as well. They will be managing the club's funds and communicating with the vice presidents and other members to decide on meeting times that would work for most people. On top of that, they will also be leading a small group in creating a visual novel.

There were will be at least 2 co vice-presidents. They do not need to be as well-rounded as the president in the three aspects (drawing, coding, and writing), but will be expected to know a little bit of each. They will be small group leaders as well.

New leadership will be appointed by former leadership on a two-stage application system. First is the writing portion, where the applicant's overall activeness in the club and their knowledge on Ren'Py will be assessed. The second part is a short 5 to 15 minute interview to ascertain their leadership and communication skills. Questions like ""how would you respond to a situation where a student in a small group is inactive and not doing their part to create the game?"" will be asked. To ensure that leadership is transferred and that the club sustains, at least one person in leadership at any given time will be a junior, sophomore, or freshman.

If anyone in leadership skips more than 3 meetings in a row, they will automatically undergo the ""impeachment"" process. Members of the club will vote on whether or not they believe the member should stay in leadership; if 2/3 or more disagree, then they will removed and replaced with someone else (refer to the application process on how the replacement will work).","Stuy Ren'Py encourages members to see STEM and liberal arts as two sides of the same coin as opposed to a coin and a dollar bill. They encourage and help each other flourish; one cannot exist without the other. This is reflected in the visual novels the club will create, as visual novels simply cannot exist without teamwork between the writers, artists, and coders. Members are also encouraged to overlap between different fields; feel free to try out drawing AND coding, coding AND writing, etc!","Our meeting schedule will vary, but we aim to meet twice each month.

Stuyvesant Armenian Club,armenia,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/armenia/99b8148f,"Stuyvesant Armenian Club aims to foster a community of Armenians and Armenian allies interested in learning more about the culture. 

","As a consequence of the Armenian Genocide of 1914, the country's diaspora was significantly spread across the globe. While it is estimated that 7 to 9 million Armenians live across the world, over half live outside of Armenia, with over 1.5 million calling the United States their home. Seeking refuge, earlier generations of Armenian people were forced to find community in the new areas they settled, including the NYC area. Connecting with other Armenians has historically been challenging as many families have been forced to assimilate. This has led to a loss in traditional and ritual practices, as well as a decline in the language. This is further perpetuated by the restrictions for Americans to travel to Armenia given the security issues of the region. The Stuyvesant Armenian Club seeks to unite ethnically Armenian students and allies to learn more about the potentially lost history and customs. In this club, members will learn about Armenian culture by sharing recipes, traditions, stories, language, and food. 
","Stuyvesant Armenian Club will benefit the Stuyvesant community because not only does it foster a community for Armenians to connect, but it also allows the student body as a whole to further immerse themselves in a culture that has been historically suppressed. Many people do not even know Armenia is a country. There are many false assumptions made about the location, position, and history of the Armenian people. Controversially, many national leaders still deny the fact that 1.6 million people were killed in the genocide. The youngest generations of Armenians need to reclaim and promote this heritage. Forging newfound respect and honor is an essential part of any identity formation. As we lead the next generation for greater equity, celebrating Armenian identity is an essential part of our ongoing development. As a club, members will collectively bolster heritage and connection to Armenian culture. The promise of this club extends beyond Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant Armenian Club will attend the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day Parade at Times Square in April, along with events organized by the Armenian General Benevolent Union. Although the Genocide is in the past, Armenia still faces opposition from their neighbors. Together Stuyvesant Armenian Club will raise money and awareness for the large Armenian population experiencing ethnic cleansing and isolation in Artsakh. 
",Instagram: @stuyarmenianclub Facebook: Stuyvesant Armenian Club,"Currently, there are two co-presidents who are sophomores. By the end of their junior year, the presidents (with input from the entirety of the club) will nominate two vice presidents who are underclassmen. Throughout the following year, the vice presidents and presidents will collaborate together to ensure a seamless transition between the generations of leadership. The presidents will teach the co-presidents how to lead and organize the meetings. The vice presidents will become presidents after their predecessors graduate. As for impeachment processes, each leader gets three strikes. Anyone from the club may initiate a strike if they believe that the leader has wronged the club or been neglectful of their responsibilities. Once the three-strike threshold has been reached, the leader will be impeached. They are welcome to come to the following meetings as a member. The club as a whole will nominate a new leader to take over the impeached leader’s place. 
","Establishing the Stuyvesant Armenian Club will be an inaugural opportunity. Although many culture clubs exist, no other Armenian club has ever existed at Stuyvesant. While this club may not attract a large number of students, its presence in the school acknowledges the diversity of the Stuyvesant student body. Armenia is an incredibly unique nation with traditions that have been upheld for millennia. Stuyvesant Armenian Club aims to more formally recognize Armenia as a rich culture in the global diaspora, and introduce others to our culture. 

","Our meeting schedule relies largely on member availability. However, Stuyvesant Armenian Club plans on meeting once every two weeks.

We run the school’s official sports Instagram account @stuysports and post relevant PSAL and sports-related content, as well as organize events and games involving PSAL teams, students, and teachers. We focus on maintaining Stuyvesant’s sports media presence through members attending games frequently (both for the spectator presence and to keep the association updated on Stuy PSAL happenings) and photographers who take pictures at live events and games as well as on media days organized by the SAA for each team. We host mandatory meetings every other week (with both photographers and members) to plan for upcoming events and PSAL games. Most members will focus on certain sports and be part of groups within the association that will be dedicated to highlighting specific sports. Most importantly, members are expected to be enthusiastic about all Stuyvesant sports and attend games and meetings whenever possible. ","The Athletic Association will benefit the Stuyvesant community as a group dedicated to unifying the student body through athletics. One goal of the association is to increase student involvement in sports and live game attendance, and keep students and faculty updated on PSAL events/achievements. Many Stuyvesant athletes are incredibly talented, and many teams see historical success, but neither individuals nor teams are properly recognized for their accomplishments. The association aims to acknowledge the athletic achievements of student-athletes and sports teams. We will also bring unity to the Stuyvesant community as a whole. Few things are as uniting as sports, and they have a unique capability to bring people together. We want athletics at Stuy to be a source of school pride and school spirit. The @stuysports Instagram has been rapidly growing—the account’s following has already increased by over 300% since last year. We want to make sure this revitalization of sports culture at Stuy doesn’t lose momentum. In the long-term, the SAA will benefit the Stuyvesant community by bringing the school body together by increasing their interest in sports. Many schools take great pride in their athletic achievements, but Stuyvesant often garners a reputation for having an inferior caliber of teams. This is a baseless claim that the SAA hopes to disprove. Our athletes deserve to be celebrated and acknowledged, both by the Stuyvesant community and by other schools, and the SAA is determined to deliver this respect. ",https://www.instagram.com/stuysports/,"There is one President of the association, who will curate and organize the creation of social media content and lead event planning. The Vice President will work closely with the President and maintain many of the same responsibilities, but one President will control the Instagram account so as to keep a consistent media presence and voice. The VP will be a junior who will be President their senior year. A Director of Photography will head the photographic operations at games and on media days and manage the rest of the photographers in the association. At the end of each school year, the President and VP will hold interviews and appoint the next VP and Director. If issues arise, association members can report to either of the three leaders and leaders/members may be removed if necessary. Members are expected to be dedicated to their assigned sport(s) and be informed enough to keep the association updated on the team. ","The association is unique in both its approach to promoting Stuyvesant’s athletics and in the way we have structured our long-term goals for the organization. Firstly, the SAA uses the @stuysports instagram account to increase awareness of athletic events. The use of social media enables increased outreach both within and outside of the school environment. We hope to impact as many students as possible to increase engagement and audience at athletic events and games, but we are simultaneously seeking to spur interaction with other schools and organizations, as well as the Stuyvesant alumni community, to generate funding and further engagement. Additionally, the SAA is seeking to leave a lasting impression on Stuyvesant that will continue to be maintained and furthered by future Presidents and VPs. The long-term goal of the SAA is to create a culture at Stuyvesant that not only acknowledges and celebrates academic achievements, but also athletic ones. Eventually, the SAA’s goal is to increase the unity of the student body by increasing the overall engagement and school pride as it relates to sports.

Some of BPA’s other major programs include the National Leadership Academy, National Officer elections and scholarships. The Torch Awards Program and BPA Cares Program recognize students and chapters, respectively, for their leadership and service to their chapter and community. We expect members of the club to attend most meetings, pay attention during meetings, pay attention fully, finish their assignments and be willing to learn.
","Business Professionals of America is the nation’s leading CTSO (Career Technical Student Organization) providing students and members with invaluable skill development and the opportunity to make personal connections. Students that join The Stuyvesant Business Professionals of America Club have the opportunity to further their knowledge and prepare for a career in today’s fast paced business environments. We offer an assortment of engaging learning tracks that will strengthen their core understanding and lay the foundation for the next steps in their lives. There will be various competitions available to students which they can learn from. Additionally, from the club, Stuyvesant students will prepare themselves for careers in business of their choice. Some of the career options include Business Administration, Finance & Accounting, Information Technology, Video Production, Human Resources, Computer Programming, Graphic & Web Design, and Small Business Entrepreneurship. This club will be the only at our school to allow for students to prepare themselves for these careers. Additionally, the club will allow students who have an interest in business to decide on which part of business interests them most. Therefore, our club will build crucial skills, allow students to make new connections, help students choose a career path and familiarize themselves with it. ",,"There will be six leadership positions: President, Vice President, Head of Business Department, Head of Finance Department, Head of Entrepreneurship Department and Social Media Manager. The current vice president will elect the future vice president(before they graduate) and the current president will elect the future president(before they graduate). The Head of Business Department, The Head of Finance Department, The Head of Entrepreneurship Department and the Social Media Manager will be chosen from an application process consisting of a written portion and an interview.

In New York City, there are various world class think-tanks and over 100 foreign Missions to the United Nations and Consulate Generals. Each Mission represents its nation politically, economically and culturally. By visiting foreign Missions or inviting diplomats and experts, club members will be able to hear their unique stories. On the other hand, think-tanks will help the students to learn to analyze international and historical issues regarding the decisions of the leaders in a more comprehensive way. Eventually, students will also be part of historical essay competitions and be assisted to enter into history-related internships. There are many national and state opportunities to compete with people in similar interests, and there will be many opportunities provided based on individual interests. Upperclassmen will also share their knowledge and information with underclassmen about what the internship admission process and the overall job is like, and students will share their experiences, including any encounters related to socio-political decisions and how they shaped the living environment of people. ","Students will be exposed to multiple insightful activities both inside and outside of school, and they will be able to have a wider perspective in viewing history from various perspectives. This will help students taking history courses to build on extra important details to the knowledge they previously had. Not only will this benefit the students academically, but they will also be able to experience interactions among different grade levels to share social experiences. Students will also learn how to conduct teamwork for relatively longer periods of time compared to school group projects, allowing them to develop important project management skills that are crucial in the real world. Through visiting various institutions and historically relevant sites, students will be allowed to explore and expand their understanding of historical events and processes that the school curriculum may not have had enough time to fully dive into. This furthermore assists students considering professions related to social studies to think more about what jobs exist and what people do in such professions. Exchanging ideas with and having Q & A sessions with experts ranging from diplomats to historians as well as each other will deepen students’ understanding of other countries and how they interact with each other, not to mention the main purpose of this club: decisions of previous leaders. ",,"The club is composed of one President, two Vice Presidents, and Members. New leadership positions (President and Vice President) will be elected annually by a majority vote of members. The elections will be held every time the people with leadership positions leave the club, and leaders (including the formal one) will create a list of people most suitable for the next leadership based on the participation and efforts shown. The overall election will engage all the members, and the two candidates with the majority of votes will be selected. The elections will be redone with these two candidates, and the majority will receive the eventual leadership. There are potential unwanted chances of impeachment if a lack of participation and care of the club is shown. When such an attitude is shown, with the assistance of the faculty advisor, the other two leaders will make an anonymous vote to the group members, and with the vote of ⅔ approval of the group members, the impeachment will be done. Other matters in the Club can be decided by majority vote, such as potential trips and cap of competition members.","The Club is unique in that no previous clubs have covered specifically past and current leaders and their links with how this shaped humanity. In addition, the club will heavily focus on visiting places in New York City, which provides students with outside-of-school activities which can’t be frequently done in conventional history courses. Students will also have opportunities to read various magazines and new articles heavily focused on the topic, and the multiple visits outside of school will provide students with unique opportunities to link their knowledge to external sources, thus enriching their academic and social connections.

Students who would like to join can apply to be a helper if they feel like they are good at helping others with their speech. This club will host meetings where members learn how to put more charm in their speech and speak with confidence. Lessons on what words to use in different scenarios, interaction activities between club members, and bonding time where members can share their own unique experiences. Members are not required to do anything, simply being there once every month is enough. If anyone, club member or not, is struggling with speech or text and is in need of assistance, StuyCharizzma will always have its doors open to help resolve their issues. This club is a judgment-free zone as everyone starts off at a different level in their social skills, we strive to create a place of comfort for the helpers and students. This club is quite lenient with its rules, as club members can do whatever they want as long as they are not a disruption or nuisance. However, any shape or form of bullying will not be tolerated in this club. Students are expected to follow basic school guidelines and safety protocols. 
","Many students at Stuyvesant struggle with social interactions. Whether it is participating in a class discussion, starting a conversation with someone new, or trying to impress a romantic interest, Stuy Charizzma will make these things seem natural and easy. The skills learned in this club are not limited to applications in purely social settings, but will carry throughout one’s life and whichever endeavors one pursues, whether it be in a college/job interview, business meeting, or when working in a team. The core principle of this club is that everyone can improve themselves and actively doing so will increase their confidence and self-image. Many people believe that they need to be extroverted or that they must be inherently good at socializing but we at StuyCharizzma believe that charisma is a skill that can be practiced and learned. An important aspect of any social interaction is picking up on cues that could come from body language or vocal tone. Noticing such nuances can help one know how to respond in any situation. The activities provided by this club can assist less social individuals by nudging them out of their comfort zone and allowing them to experience new things in a safe and friendly environment.

Members and leaders are expected to treat everyone with respect. If members are uncomfortable around or complaining about a leader, they can either confront the leader or go to someone with a similar or higher power to address the situation. There is a grade difference between the founders so it is expected that the younger founder will appoint a new founder to lead the club when the upperclassmen are gone. If a leader must be removed for whatever reason, the founders could have a vote and choose whether to remove their role.

For each student thinking about joining Stuymesh, think of Stuy Mesh as an opportunity to learn about new hobbies and interests. Although Stuyvesant has many people knowledgeable in any given 3D modeling software, most of them are independent, making learning or asking a question about 3D modeling extremely challenging. Thus, we aim to gather people with previous experience to help guide new learners. After 5-6 months of learning, the members will help other new learners or keep improving with help. Through out the year, Stuy Mesh will do a check-in on each modeler to see their progress. By the end of each year, Stuy Mesh will host a competition with prizes to see who has the best modeling skills and will help inspire new people to join Stuy, Mesh.","Stuy Mesh's benefits are the knowledge about 3D modeling that they teach and the opportunities opened through knowing 3D modeling. knowing 3D modeling software can create a very lucrative business, which can provide some commission jobs for Stuyvesant students. Additionally, knowing 3D modeling or other software can help you get part-time jobs in labs across New York: Cornell tech, etc. Stuy mesh can provide the Stuyvesant community with designs for the 3D printer, and print them for merchandise in the Stuy merch store. Stuy Mesh will also provide a helpful community that will help anyone with no cuts, unless the student does something terrible, or acts disrespectfully. Through the help Stuy Mesh provides, many people will learn the technical aspects of 3D modeling and can use the knowledge to acquire future jobs relating to the knowledge learned. For example, someone who knows 3D modeling can become an animator, artist, or designer. Even if the student doesn't pick that path, knowing 3D modeling can help prepare the student for future engineering jobs. 3D modeling will also teach the student how to create a workflow, which they can apply to their own lives to make it more efficient and to have less procrastination.",,"Stuy Mesh will appoint their leadership position through a selection of skills and duration of stay. For example, people who attend Stuy Mesh meetings every day for a long length of time, the person will likely be in a high leadership position. Not only will a leadership position be based on the duration of stay, but it will be based on skill, so a competition will be hosted yearly to see the skills of the members. Stuy Mesh members should also act politely to everyone, and not disrespect anyone, or insult anyone's skill at modeling. Stuy mesh will have someone transfer their leadership role through having a private list of good choices for the position of leadership; however, if deemed that the person in charge of this selection is corrupt in any way, they will be spoken to, and replaced by a majority vote of all the helpers in Stuy Mesh. ","Stuy Mesh is special because it will host a yearly competition that directly defines leadership positions. Moreover, Stuy Mesh also aims to create a learning center for 3D modeling in Stuyvesant, making it unique because there aren't any other clubs trying to teach specifically 3D modeling. Stuy mesh is also a center for professionals to gather, which makes it a reliable resource for people. Furthermore, Stuyvesant is a stem school, so it's rigid in its teaching structure, and can limit creativity. Therefore, having a club to help foster creativity in students is unique.

Most of our positions will also involve teaching and instruction, so our elections will involve either an audition or a judgment based on skill level. Outside of high ranking positions, involved club members may also be appointed with positions relating outside the realm of just music, such as social media producing and outreach. Leaders will be removed if they are not contributing to the team and are not participating. Members are expected to be respectful to the instruments, as many are school owned, and especially if we get the recording studio to be respectful of the equipment. As of now, our leadership spans to 2025 graduates so leadership will be transferred down the ladder as older leaders graduate. During these next few years, we hope that prospecting members in younger years will join to eventually overtake these positions and continue the legacy of the club.

Not only is PC building a fun and interesting hobby, but its financially fiscal to have a good skill in as well. If educated and taught properly, costs no longer need to go into spending hundreds or even thousands to buy or fix a new PC when you can just do it yourself!

We could continue till we get 2 applicants left. Whoever wins would become president, and whoever gets second would become vice president. Multiple voting rounds ensure fairness and representation. This process would most likely be done via google forms to ensure openness as well as protection against double voting (one vote per stuy account). 
Transferring of leadership between school years: Very similar process, with the changes that current seniors couldn't be nominated, the vote is done 2 months in advance of the closing of the year, and that the results must be approved by the current President and Vice President. If there is a tie in this case, the members would vote and decide the tie breaker.
Leader Removal: When the club is created, a removal form will be created as well, where any member can submit a reason for removal and name. The form would be anonymous, and all responses would be kept public as to ensure it isn't hidden by current leaders. If the reason is deemed serious (as in, someone didnt jokingly put in a ""they smell"" or ""plays league of legends"") the leader accused has the option to call a meeting to address the complaint/reason, and a public vote by members must be held. If a majority of votes says to ""remove,"" then that leader is removed without question and a appointment vote is started to replace the removed leader","Acts not only as a community to pursue a PC building hobby, but also as a helpline and way of assistance to any student with computer troubles, whether that be on their current devices, or any future device they want to pursue.

SOS,sos,True,https://image-cdn.stuyactivities.org/image/upload/v1/organizations/sos/aa4429f9,"SOS is essentially Stuy’s talent show! Crews and individuals from all grades are welcome to perform on this special night. 
","The Stuyvesant Outlet Showcase is meant to bring together students from all walks of life in an annual talent show! SOS is a way for students of all grades to perform together one last time and so all students are encouraged to join! There are two main sectors of the show: individual (open acts) and crew acts. Individual acts are great for soloists or small groups who have any special talent they want to show to Stuy. If you’re shyer or more reserved, and would rather perform with some of your peers and friends, there are an abundance of crews you can join, including, but not limited to, Stuyvesant Philharmonic, K-POP, Flow, and Latin. Some of these crews are existing clubs, so this is also a great opportunity to spark and continue your interest in the following year. The ultimate purpose of this show is to unify the Stuyvesant community through performances of the arts. ","The Stuyvesant Outlet Showcase (SOS) will benefit everyone in the Stuyvesant community, not just those performing, but those watching or part of the process. 
A sense of community is created through Stuyvesant Outlet Showcase. SOS encourages students who are unfamiliar to dance crews or who were too afraid to audition for StuySquad or SING, to try something new. Most importantly, because it takes place at the end of the year, many students take it as an opportunity to relieve the stress and sign off the year on a good note. Students who aren’t interested in performing are also given the opportunity to watch and cheer on their friends from the audience. Having this bonding experience to wrap off the year will be a great way for friendships to grow and talents to be displayed to the school. 
As stated before, this activity will also be an opportunity for students to partake in the arts. Many of these crews and clubs performing require no experience of any kind, opening the paths and increasing the opportunities for future student aspirations. Many of these students who start out performing on SOS will hopefully do that same club or crew during the school year even after the show is over. 
",@stuyoutletshowcase,"The current leadership positions are within the SOS Board, which is composed of 6 members who are responsible to oversee the production of the showcase. Due to time limitations this year, the board was selected based on individual recruitment, taking into consideration previous experience and an attempt to cover all aspects of the showcase (ie. music and vocal elements compared to dance and performance). The current board consists of 5 juniors, each with relevant leadership experience, and one underclassman who will take on the responsibility of leading the board next year. In future processions, the board will likely be selected based on an application basis, with an encouragement to have at least one leader-in-training role occupied by an underclassman in order to transfer leadership most effectively between school years. In order to ensure SOS runs smoothly, there will be a consistent board set in place with the capability to advise and facilitate diverse performance styles. 
","The Stuyvesant Outlet Showcase is unique because it is the only club that allows participants with various talents to perform under one showcase. SOS is comprised of various dance and musical crews alongside individual talents allowing students of all backgrounds to perform as one. No other club or showcase allows for students to perform on this big of a scale. This is arguably one of the biggest productions and is projected to be one of Stuyveants’ biggest shows and highlights of many students’ experiences. 
","There are no set meetings for SOS. You can practice as much or as little as you like, as long as you can produce a good performance by the show date. Evaluations will also be given out by the board members to make sure all performances are on track. Crews are expected to have regular practice that will be determined by individual crews’ directors.

Weekly meetings will be held to educate members about various aspects of Filipino culture, provide a space to interact with new people, and give members opportunities to participate in fun activities connected to the culture. For example, club members will try Filipino food, review and have discussions about Filipino media, and learn about the Filipino languages and dialects together. Stuyvesant Filipino Club aims to hold charity concerts in order to raise funds for underprivileged schools and/or disaster relief in the Philippines. Members will be given a chance to perform for the showcase or assist in the production aspect. Participation in these events are not strictly required, but highly encouraged to create an enjoyable experience for club members. Although Stuyvesant does not have a large Filipino population, Stuyvesant Filipino Club hopes to create a safe space to create new friendships and embrace Filipino heritage.
","Immigrants from the Philippines comprise the second largest immigrant group in the United States. However, the Filipino population within Stuyvesant is still quite small. The Philippines is a country with thousands of different islands, dialects, and experiences to offer. In this space, Stuyvesant Filipino Community offers an open door to create conversations for Filipinos to meet others that might understand them and their experiences, and to share these experiences with members that may just be interested in the culture! Introducing Filipino media and language to Stuyvesant’s community on a larger scale as an official club will foster a better understanding of the culture for students, as well as a direct means for FIlipino-American students to connect with their roots. Filipinos are slowly making its way into mainstream media with artists such as beabadoobee, Grent Perez, and Zack Tabudlo, and influencers like Bretman Rock and Mr. Papagayo! Stuyvesant Filipino Club intends to create a space in which students can experience and appreciate this evolving Filipino-American culture together. Stuyvesant Filipino club will collaborate with Filipino clubs in other NYC high schools to provide the highest quality events to students for a comprehensive cultural experience.

In order to instate new leadership, the current leaders will ask members of the club for interest in the leadership position near the end of the school year. Interested members will then be asked to answer a few questions about their experience in the club, their ideas to help better it, and how they would feasibly achieve these goals. Based on these answers and a short interview, current leaders will choose the candidates they best see fit for the position. During the transition of leadership positions between school years, current club leaders will assist the newly appointed in organizing meetings and events to ensure that the new leaders are prepared for the year ahead. If necessary, discussions will be had among leaders and the members of the club to discuss a leader’s removal from their position due to inappropriate behavior or excessive absence.","Stuyvesant Filipino Club is a unique space because it is curated specifically for those who appreciate Filipino culture and are willing to learn more about it. In addition to its historical richness, a big part of Filipino-American culture is the love for singing and performing, which is incorporated into many aspects of the club. Stuyvesant Filipino Club aims to respond to its members’ topics of interests in order to create a space that is both engaging and educational.","Our meeting schedule varies depending on school-sanctioned events and testing, but we will meet at least twice a month (typically on Thursdays), with a special event such as a charity concert or karaoke night at least once a month.

Members of the club are expected to respond to questions with the best interest of the person who asked for advice in mind as well as reply in a kindhearted manner. They should also not be rude to or mock any of the other members. Although it is not a requirement, members are encouraged to ask for advice for their own problems if they need it. Members are also encouraged to attend as many meetings as they can, but are not required to come to all of them if they do not wish to or are not available. During meetings, members can submit questions that they have and requests for advice anonymously and receive the help of the other members. We will also have other activities that will help us empathize with each other and grow as a community. In addition to meetings, members can ask for advice online through a Google Form any time that they may need it. They can also choose whether they would like for their submission to be anonymous and whether they would like it to be posted on social media.

","Stuy Advice Column will serve as a safe space for students to turn to when in need of a wide variety of input on advice. Because the club is available for all grades to join, multiple perspectives can be given to an issue, enabling the student who sought help to evaluate the problem from the lens of peers with a range of ages, backgrounds, cultures, and more. By involving students in the lives of one another, those at Stuyvesant can experience the feeling of putting themselves in others’ shoes and gain valuable insight from considering a problem from all angles. Not only will a multitude of responses be given to each and every call for advice, but they also will be sent in a quick and accessible manner. Members of the club are encouraged — and the leaders are required — to give their advice within a certain time period, so those who desire aid will always walk away prepared to face their problem. If the student asking for help permits their submission to be posted publicly, the community at Stuyvesant will be able to learn from the experiences of their peers and potentially resolve their own issues through the answers given to another advice seeker.

If a member of the club wishes to be considered for a leadership position, they will fill out an application form that the leaders will use to gauge whether they should be considered as a candidate. Once a select number of candidates have been chosen, club members will vote on who they believe best fits the role of the leadership position in question, with the categories of activeness and enthusiasm in mind.

Members of a baking book club can increase their baking knowledge and read books they might not have picked otherwise, expanding their perspectives.

The Youth Engineering Studio serves as a student-led workshop for younger students all over New York City to explore engineering in a space that fosters curiosity and innovation. YES introduces engineering concepts to students using low-tech approaches to emphasize the accessibility of engineering and bridge the gap between low-income students and STEM opportunities. Through these concepts, YES hopes to teach students basic engineering, help them build their problem-solving skills, train them to work collaboratively, and above all, inspire them to be creative in whatever they do. YES strives to expand the scope of learning and increase learner engagement by framing lessons around hands-on activities and experiments. Mentees are given the opportunity to experiment with what is in front of them before they are taught, which activates creative thinking. YES mentors are encouraged to teach engineering concepts that they are interested in, which can be brainstormed during logistics meetings, and mentoring teams will work together to research topics and create their own lesson plans. Although YES mentors do not have to be experienced in engineering, they should be eager to develop their own engineering skills in order to teach and lead a group of younger students during the studio sessions. YES is not only a great opportunity for younger students to learn, but for high school students as well.","The Youth Engineering Studio welcomes members and volunteers from various high schools across New York City, working together toward the common goal of helping kids explore the world of engineering. Stuyvesant members will contribute to a larger organization whose mission is to provide a fun and safe space—a studio—for younger students to experiment with hands-on activities such as building bridges, towers, circuits, Rube Goldberg machines, and many other structures. By being part of a team, YES members will gain valuable skills such as communication, management, organization, creativity, dedication, leadership, and patience, among others. YES also aims to encourage its high school members to be passionate and driven, while giving back to the community. Members will have the opportunity to further their own interest in engineering, or even business. YES mentors will get a glimpse into what it takes to be a teacher, from building their own lessons and planning accompanying activities to being on the forefront of shaping the education of the younger generation. YES management teams will learn first-hand what it takes to run an organization, from social media marketing to organizing fundraisers.

They are then welcome to apply for a board position through a series of short answer questions and an interview conducted by the executive board. Applications will be sent out before the end of the school year for the summer cycle, when current leaders will work with newly selected leaders to prepare them for the upcoming school cycle. The selected leaders will assume full responsibility of their respective roles by the start of the school year. Any leader who fails to deliver on their responsibilities and/or violates proper conduct can be removed from their position by a majority vote of the other leaders.",There are few initiatives that encourage and offer the opportunity for young students to dive head-first into the field of engineering.

","StuySudan plans to educate Stuyvesant students on Sudanese culture and customs, as well as Sudan’s rich history and contemporary issues. Sudan is a beautiful, diverse, and vast country that goes under-appreciated due to its overshadowing humanitarian crises and ignorance from the general population. Since its independence in 1956, Sudan has had many issues. Most recently, a civil war between two military groups has caused severe destruction and violence within Sudan, but little mainstream news coverage has been made about it. Not only will StuySudan raise awareness about what’s happening in Sudan, it will work towards raising money to help solve these issues. Speaker events will be hosted by people involved in efforts to help Sudan, whether through activist or humanitarian work. Fundraisers like bake sales and paid-attendance cultural events will also be hosted. StuySudan hopes to connect with non-profit organizations and charities to meet these goals. General members are expected to attend meetings and make an active effort to learn about Sudan. They will assist with fundraising and other events. 
","This activity will benefit the Stuyvesant students as it will enlighten them on the lives and struggles of the Sudanese people. Students will be given the ability to fundraise and help raise awareness for an important cause with the guidance of StuySudan. Stuyvesant students will be given the opportunity to attend informative speaker events hosted by StuySudan. Students will also be able to gain a sense of community and personal fulfillment within StuySudan. Sudan is largely ignored in the curriculum even though it is very important in contemporary times. Most students are not only unaware of the issues in Sudan, but would barely even be able to recognize Sudan as a nation even at these times. StuySudan will allow students to educate themselves and ask questions in a non-judgmental space. It will give students a space to learn outside the classroom. Authentic and passionate students will find a space to channel their desire to do good. It will aid and help students in learning about real activist work. They will be encouraged to participate in activist work that will aid them in several real life situations. StuySudan will benefit the Stuyvesant community through enrichment, awareness and collaboration between students regarding Sudan.
",@stuysudan ~ Instagram,"The President and Vice President have been chosen for this term due to their knowledge of Sudan and dedication to help its people. If for any reason, any leader misses more than two meetings or neglects their assigned duties without communication, or acts in a way unbecoming of a leader (ex. misuses fundraised money, produces hate speech), they will be impeached through a discussion with the leadership board. Any member who has shown interest is allowed to apply for a leadership position. Leaders will be appointed by current leaders based on their leadership abilities and dedication to the club. There will be an application and interview process to evaluate the applicants. If necessary, there will be other leadership positions such as treasurer, event planner, or social media manager, which will be appointed similarly. These positions will be chosen and given out to the members after the initiation of the club.
","StuySudan is an unique organization, because there is no other active organization at Stuyvesant that focuses on Sudan, or any other African nation for that matter. StuySudan will be the only organization that effectively spreads awareness not only about Sudan’s struggles, but its rich history and culture, while also fundraising to help its people. It will be the first organization to foster a sense of community for Sudanese students at Stuyvesant, as well as the first organization to educate the Stuyvesant community about Sudan.

In addition to providing opportunities to see live performances, Stuy Classical Music Listeners provides students with an environment to share their interest in Classical Music. In meetings, we hope to get together to listen and discuss Classical Music together. In order to get tickets, forms will be sent out before upcoming performances. There are a limited number of tickets, so it will be first come first serve. If someone receives a ticket, they will not be considered for the next 3 ticket opportunities so that everyone has an equal opportunity to receive tickets. There will be sporadic ticket opportunities throughout the year depending on when we can get them.","Classical music concerts are expensive! Therefore, many within the Stuyvesant community, despite having an interest in Classical Music, are unable to attend classical music performances. This club aims to remedy that by giving those students opportunities to foster their interest by seeing live performances by the New York City Ballet and New York Philharmonic. Music is something which has a healing power. Classical music is something which can touch us deeply emotionally and move us all. By providing an environment where students can all get together to appreciate classical music, students can all experience the transformative power of classical music. Furthermore, students can discover new beautiful music. A student's new favorite piece is always just one recommendation away. In a world dominated by pop music, it is often very hard to find anyone who loves composers like Beethoven, Bach, and Tchaikovsky over pop musicians like Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift. This club provides the opportunity to find those Beethoven, Bach, and Tchaikovsky lovers. Additionally, classical music is by far the best type of music to study to, so by introducing Stuyvesant students to classical music, we are improving people's study habits. Classical music is a language that everyone can speak and Stuyvesant Classical Music Listeners hopes to extend that language to all those who want it.",Discord: https://discord.gg/gMHHamMcqq,"Stuy Classical Music Listeners will have two presidents who will stay in power until they graduate or are impeached. When these presidents graduate, the club will be transferred to the two candidates most capable of leading the club and maintaining a strong connection with NYC musicians so that free ticket opportunities can still happen. The club executive board will have a vice president, secretary, and an outreach director. These board members will be appointed by the presidents and will be appointed based on who is the most qualified for the role. The vice president will help run meetings and will help carry out the duties of the presidents. The secretary will help with managing the club as well as any necessary paperwork. The outreach director will help promote the club, run the social media accounts, and maintain the connections with NYC musicians. All board members will have to reapply at the beginning of each semester. Any leader who does not fulfill their responsibilities will be removed.","While there are a multitude of clubs at Stuyvesant dedicated to music, there is currently no club dedicated to just the appreciation of classical music. Many students have an interest in classical music, but wish to share that interest through Classical Music appreciation rather than musical performance. Stuy Classical Music Listeners plays into that perfectly by allowing such students to discuss and appreciate music with others as well as potentially attend performances by the New York City Ballet and New York Philharmonic.",Our meeting schedule will be based off of availabilty polls.,"['tuesday', 'thursday']",low,"['classical', 'music', 'orchestra']",,"Aidan Kuo - President

","In the Native American, Hawaiian and Alaskan (NAHA) club, members meet once a month to build an inclusive environment for indigenous students to gather. Ad hoc meetings are not mandatory, but attendance is highly encouraged as we will occasionally have guest speakers presenting. The President plans a different activity for each meeting, which is meant to expose or introduce members to different indigenous cultures and traditions of Native Americans, Native Hawaiians and Native Alaskans. Activities include joining zoom meetings with speakers, playing Kahoots, learning about cultural sites, and watching films about native communities. Members are expected to come and be ready to listen and learn about historical figures and the importance of Indigenous People’s Day. It is also recommended to participate in the Kahoots or other games. Our purpose is to not only celebrate Native peoples, but also to share their history and recognize the hardships the community has gone through since Europeans sailed to the Americas.","The NAHA Club is very beneficial to the Stuyvesant community because members have the chance to meet other people in Stuy who have similar cultural heritage, and bond over shared traditions, pastimes, and experiences. Members will learn more about the history of Native people, such as their different cultures and communities, as well as their history and struggles following the arrival of Europeans in the 1400s. Additionally, some of our meetings will be designated for learning about the pre- and post-colonial history of the Americas. This can be helpful to those taking history courses, such as US History and AP World, that contain content about indigenous people in the Americas. The information we will share is useful to people of all cultures in Stuyvesant, and people who do not identify as Indigenous are welcome to join to learn more about the history of our continent's first people. Many people in the Stuyvesant community will benefit from this as they can learn more about the people and their communities found in the American continents before them. Members will also be able to stay updated about current events regarding the issues Indigenous people face today, such as concerns over reservations, wildlife, and sustainability.",,"Every year, there will be President and Vice President positions. During the President's senior year, there will be an application for President. The selected President will choose the future Vice President(s). If at any point the majority of the members believe new leadership is needed, then members can discuss with others in leadership positions to decide a succession plan and course of action. The President and Vice President(s) are responsible for planning events, running the meetings and marking down attendance. They must also ensure respectful conversation is occurring during the meetings. In order to be voted into a position of leadership, members must attend at least half of the meetings each year and be ready to commit to all of the aforementioned responsibilities. Vice Presidents are responsible for helping the President with tasks as assigned. By being an active member in this club, you are likely to receive a leadership position.","This club is dedicated to Indigenous people who identify as Native American, Native Hawaiian or Native Alaskan. We are a low commitment club, but have high aspirations of educating the masses. We encourage everyone to stop by in order to learn about the people who were here before Europeans stepped foot on the Americas, their way of life, and their current struggles.

","This Club’s aim is to provide a place where people can play soccer with their friends for fun in an organized fashion. The club will also help its members get better at the game, as it provides practice and allows them to learn from experienced players. In meetings, club members should expect activities anywhere from World Cup (a soccer game), to full-on games depending on how many members are present and what they want to do. Generally, participants are expected to be kind and respectful, especially about skill level, as well as show up to meetings from time to time. If possible members are recommended to bring their own soccer balls to meetings. Even though this club is low commitment, meaning you do not have to show up to every meeting, we hope to have many meetings so that regular and enthusiastic members can have fun while forming stronger friendships with their fellow club members. 
","Hello potential members, here are some of the benefits of joining Footbal 4 Fun!

 Stuyvesant’s rigorous academics often lead to a lack of stress relief which can negatively impact one's mental and phyical health. How can you relax if you have to study and cant organize a meeting with your friends? This club solves that issue by creating a space where members can have fun, relax, and meet new friends. Not only is this club good for mental health but it is good for physical health as well. Playing soccer is one of the best ways to get and stay in tip-top shape. Anyone who joins can also greatly improve their skills in football, after all, practice makes perfect, especially when it is with others who might be able to teach you. Whether it be practicing in a small group, full-on games, or just discussing football we hope that our members and the Stuyvesant community gain all that they hope from this club! Lastly, wether you join the club or not we at Football 4 Fun encourage you to play soccer, its a fun and healthy hobbie that makes lasting friendships! 

From the club members, we hope you have a great day and hopefully you join!
",https://discord.gg/G892wZjX,"The leadership positions are President, Vice presidents, Veterans, and regular members. The president is the leader of the club and has all the power. The vice presidents have most of the power of the president but need to ask them before making a major decision. On top of that, if the majority of the vice presidents vote too, with reasonable cause, they can “suspend,” even “impeach” the president, or veto his decisions. Veterans can make some changes in the club as a whole but for the most part act as leaders and guides to help new members to get oriented around, learn, and make new friends. Regular members are generally new additions to the club. They can participate in all activities but don't have much say within the club’s rules as they are new. There will be one president, up to eight vice presidents, unlimited veterans as long as they are experienced and unlimited regular members. 
","This club is unique from others in many ways. The main ones are that it not only teaches its members something, but it also benefits their health, all while being fun and inclusive for all. Members can learn how to play better, they can get plenty of exercise, burning almost 500 calories and hour, relax with friends, and there are no cutoffs, you can be a complete newbie to a excerpt, everyone is welcome and encouraged to join when they can!

We will discuss well-known court cases and bring notable/influential guest speakers to give us an insight into various types of law. As a group, we will talk about gender inequality to empower women to raise their voices and help each other grow as individuals. In addition, we will have debates and arguments on certain topics to strengthen our public speaking and communication skills. In general, this club will provide leadership opportunities, motivate students to pursue law, and help students work together. It is a great way to gain further understanding for the future and learn more about what law is like. Even though we are a women-oriented club, we are inclusive of all genders. 
","This club will benefit the Stuyvesant community by increasing an understanding of the law and legal procedures. Students will be able to learn more about the First and Second Amendments, allowing students to engage in conversations about how the government affects the law and the impacting decisions of the supreme court. Needless to say, we will go over important cases in our U.S. history and social studies classes, such as the Dred Scott case, Brown v. Board, Roe v Wade, Obergefell V Hodges, Miranda V Arizona, etc. Furthermore, this club will also allow students to have academic debates among their peers and let students foster critical thinking skills; thus, creating a public forum of opportunities and success. As a respective community, we will encourage students to be active within their neighborhood and permit students to be more engaged and informed. Fundamentally speaking, stuy women in law will also prepare students for the future and give them a glimpse of law and how it plays into society. Students will be able to go on court trips and deepen their knowledge and spark more interest in this career; through this, they will acquire more information and increase the visibility of the Stuyvesant body. ",@stuywomeninlaw,"As for leadership positions, there is already a president and co-president, but we will have a vice president, director of outreach, secretary general, social and media director, and chair members. Leaders will be appointed through senior leaders, while directors will be appointed based on experience and their commitment level to this club. Presidents are in charge of maintaining the club and creating informational slides, while directors will bring guest speakers, organize trips, and promote the club. Members are to remain respectful towards others and refrain from using vulgar language, bullying, and discriminating against their peers. On the contrary, the chair is to keep the presidents and members in check. In case of corruption or leaders not fulfilling their requirements or expected behavior, members of the chair will vote, and if the selective leader thinks it's unfair they can appeal. All appeals will be advised by faculty advisors and the Student Union.","Stuy Women in Law is a unique club that allows more room for visibility for women in the humanities field.

","The purpose of this club is to foster a community that encourages STEM education and hands-on projects that give people experience in different fields. This would include a wide variety of activities such as investigating biodiversity in an urban environment, studying the epigenetic changes brought on by stress, or building a programming language from scratch. Different departments can also collaborate on projects that pertain to both subjects, creating an interconnected web of research and cooperation. A large part of Stuy STEM Initiative will also be collaborating with other people and clubs to create more research opportunities for those interested in STEM. General meetings will be hosted to help orient and educate people on different STEM subjects, as well as host clubwide projects and events. Department meetings will occur asynchronously, and will allow for people with specific interests to meet and discuss research. A large portion of the club will also happen online, as the majority of the club activities will occur outside of regular meetings.","Despite the abundance of STEM kids in Stuyvesant, there is a lack of clubs or activities that ecompass multiple fields and give people actual experience in those fields. Stuy STEM Initiative aims to fufill that need by providing a simple and easy way for people to get involved in research projects. This club provides opportunities to people who may not want to dedicate a large chunk of time conducting research or teaching themselves about science. Being low commitment, Stuy STEM Initiative gives its members total freedom over how much or how little they want to do, with the expectation that they still contribute whenever they can. Stuy STEM Initiative also prepares students for future science courses, especially those with a focus on research, such as the Biology Regeneron class. These classes focus on experimental design and reviewing data, which is something that this club is based upon. Stuy STEM Initiative will also teach students important skills, such as conducting a Polymerase Chain Reaction or website design.

Though the CEO needs support of the Board of Directors for larger decisions, the role acts as the official club leader for the front-facing club activities. The CEO gets elected by a popular vote from the club. Stuy STEM Initiative also has a board of directors, which act as the main governing body for the club. Large decisions that affect the club as a whole have to go through the board of directors to get enacted, and the board is in charge of maintaining checks and balances on the CEO. Each board member is also in charge of running their respective departments, and they are able to pick their own replacements from that department. The Chairman of the Board is in charge of making sure the board of directors operates smoothly. They act as the spokesperson for the board as well as a tiebreaker for important votes. To impeach a member of leadership, the board of directors have to vote to remove that person, in the presence of the CEO and Chairman.
